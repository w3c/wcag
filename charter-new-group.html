				<h2>Background</h2>
				<section id="background-ag">
					<h3>Motivation for Accessibility Guidelines New Working Group (AG New WG)</h3>
					<p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, and also benefits older users and people without disabilities. Accessible design improves overall user experience and satisfaction, especially in a variety of situations, and across different devices. It is essential that several different components of web development and interaction work together in order for the web to be accessible to people with disabilities. These components include content technologies, web content, web browsers and media players, assistive technology, users, developers, authoring tools, and evaluation tools. Groups in the Web Accessibility Initiative work together to address accessibility for all the components.</p>
					<p>The Accessibility Guidelines New Working Group works to create accessibility guidelines to replace WCAC 2 using a new model that allows it to address more disability needs than WCAG 2.X, as well as address publishing requirements and emerging technologies.  WCAG 3 describes support from other components needed for its advice to work, such as technologies, user agents, and authoring tools. Guidelines from this Working Group are widely used by developers and implementers, referenced in industry policy, and benefit all web users.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="background-focus">
					<h3>Focus for the 2022 - 2024 Charter</h3>
					<p>The goal of this 2022 - 2024 AG New WG charter will be to put into wide (public) review one or more draft documents that demonstrate all major components of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/">W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3</a> and how they fit together. During this charter period, the WG will propose an approach for public review that addresses each of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/#requirements">WCAG 3 requirements</a> and known challenges. Examples of known challenges include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Rewriting existing guidelines,</li>
						<li>Adding guidance to address known gaps in WCAG 2,</li>
						<li>Creating new guidelines for emerging technologies,and</li>
						<li>Complex conformance challenges, such as third-party content, website conformance, scoring, accessibility statements, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Any requirement or challenge without a demonstrated solution that has AG New WG consensus by the end of the next charter will be excluded from WCAG 3. These solutions won’t be complete at the end of this charter period, but they will have enough breadth of developed material so that reviewers can understand the intended scope of WCAG 3 as a whole, and have enough depth to understand how conformance evaluations for WCAG 3 can work.</p>
					<p>By the end of the 2022 - 2024 charter AG New WG will: </p><ul>
						<li>Know what will and will not be part of WCAG 3,</li>
						<li>have a timeline for delivering WCAG 3, and </li>
						<li>have decided how the remaining parts of WCAG 3 will be delivered (all at once, in phases, or as modules.) </li>
					</ul> In the case of phases or modules, AG New WG will have the scope and requirements of those phases or modules defined for the next charter period. </section>
			</section>
			<section id="scope" class="scope">
				<h2>Scope</h2>
				<section id="scope-wcag3">
					<h3>WCAG 3 </h3>
					<p>The primary objective of the AG New WG during this charter period is to publish a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#wide-review">wide review draft</a> of WCAG 3. The goal is to get broad support for the scope and direction of WCAG 3 and work out how the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/">requirements for WCAG 3</a> can be met, including better coverage across disabilities, and be easier to maintain, so that the new framework will be more durable as technologies evolve. This wide review of WCAG 3 will include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A preliminary set of guidelines (not including outcomes or methods),</li>
						<li>A representative set of outcomes worked out in detail, along with all methods and documentation necessary to understand and test those outcomes,</li>
						<li>At least one example of each type/category of testing, 
						</li><li>A conformance model, and</li>
						<li>An approach on testing emerging technologies.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>WCAG 3 will not be brought to Recommendation during this charter period. Results of the wide review will determine scope and timeline for further work in the following charter period. Deliverables and timelines for WCAG 3 are further precised in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/wiki">WCAG 3 project plan</a>.</p>
					<section id="scope-wcag3-additional">
						<h4>Additional WCAG 3 Publications</h4>
						<p>AG New WG will explore options for publishing WCAG 3 in stages or as modules. If any part of the initial WCAG 3 will be published as a stand-alone resource, a draft will be made available within this charter period. If a transitional document between WCAG 2.2 and WCAG 3 is to be created, a first draft of it will be published by the end of the charter.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section id="scope-wcag3-conformance">
					<h4>WCAG 3 Conformance Model</h4>
					<p>In this charter period, AG New WG will define the scope of the conformance model for WCAG 3. If any part of the initial WCAG 3 recommendation will be published as a stand-alone resource, a draft will be made available within this charter period.</p>
					<p>While there will be no normative guidance for stand-alone user agents or authoring tools, WCAG 3 may include guidelines for embedded user agents and authoring tools such as an online video player built with JavaScript and HTML, or online blogging service.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="scope-other">
					<h3>Non WCAG 3 Scope</h3>
					<p>In addition to WCAG 3, the group continues existing work and materials support commitments:</p>
					<ul>
						<li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">continues addressing <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/issues"><u>open WCAG 3 issues</u></a> and public feedback and maintains interpretive support materials for its normative guidance (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-explainer/">Explainer for W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0</a>),</p></li>
						<li>performs secondary research, and engages with primary researchers, to understand better the needs of specific user groups (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/publications">Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/publications">Cognitive Accessibility User Research</a>),</li>
						<li>conducts gap analyses against deployed features to identify accessibility guidance needs (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/publications">Cognitive Accessibility Roadmap and Gap Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/publications">Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile</a>), and</li>
						<li>develops supplemental guidance, beyond that in the normative guidance, that describes enhanced accessibility for certain scenarios (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/publications">Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</a>).</li>

			<section id="success-criteria">
				<h2>Success Criteria</h2>
				<p> In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
				<p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
				<p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
				<p>There should be sufficient techniques and tests for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="coordination">
				<h2>Coordination</h2>
				<p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes
					occur in a specification following a review.</p>

				<h2> Participation </h2>
				<p> To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 15 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants. </p>
				<p>Key implementers of WCAG (desktop and non-desktop environments) include Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.), Web authoring tool developers, Web accessibility evaluation tool developers, user agent tool developers, and people with disabilities.</p>
				<p> The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>. </p>
				<p> The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>. </p>
				<p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

				<h2> Communication </h2>
				<p id="public">Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however. </p>
				<p>Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines New Working Group home page</a>. </p>
				<p>This group conducts email discussion on the public mailing list <a href="mailto:w3c-wai-gl@w3.org" id="public-name">w3c-wai-gl@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/">archive</a>). <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/">Task forces</a> and sub-groups may use additional lists or other communication mechanisms documented on their home pages. Discussion of issues for specific deliverables generally takes place in the GitHub repository identified for the deliverable. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work. </p>
