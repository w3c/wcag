            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that information and relationships
               that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation
               format changes. For example, the presentation format changes when the content is read
               by a screen reader or when a user style sheet is substituted for the style sheet provided
               by the author.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               						Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues
               — headings are often in a larger, bold font separated from paragraphs by blank lines;
               list items are preceded by a bullet and perhaps indented; paragraphs are separated
               by a blank line; items that share a common characteristic are organized into tabular
               rows and columns; form fields may be positioned as groups that share text labels;
               a different background color may be used to indicate that several items are related
               to each other; words that have special status are indicated by changing the font family
               and /or bolding, italicizing, or underlining them; items that share a common characteristic
               are organized into a table where the relationship of cells sharing the same row or
               column and the relationship of each cell to its row and/or column header are necessary
               for understanding; and so on. Having these structures and these relationships programmatically
               determined or available in text ensures that information important for comprehension
               will be perceivable to all.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Auditory cues may be used as well. For example, a chime might indicate the beginning
               of a new section; a change in voice pitch or speech rate may be used to emphasize
               important information or to indicate quoted text; etc.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               When such relationships are perceivable to one set of users, those relationships can
               be made to be perceivable to all. One method of determining whether or not information
               has been properly provided to all users is to access the information serially in different
               modalities.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>If links to glossary items are implemented using anchor elements (or the proper link
               element for the technology in use) and identified using a different font face, a screen
               reader user will hear that the item is a link when the glossary term is encountered
               even though they may not receive information about the change in font face. An on-line
               catalog may indicate prices using a larger font colored red. A screen reader or person
               who cannot perceive red, still has the information about the price as long as it is
               preceded by the currency symbol.
               
            </p>
            <p>Some technologies do not provide a means to programmatically determine some types
               of information and relationships. In that case then there should be a text description
               of the information and relationships. For instance, "all required fields are marked
               with an asterisk (*)". The text description should be near the information it is describing
               (when the page is linearized), such as in the parent element or in the adjacent element.
               
            </p>
            <p>There may also be cases where it may be a judgment call as to whether the relationships
               should be programmatically determined or be presented in text. However, when technologies
               support programmatic relationships, it is strongly encouraged that information and
               relationships be programmatically determined rather than described in text.
