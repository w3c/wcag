            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that functions triggered by moving
               a device (for example, shaking or tilting) or by gesturing towards the device (so
               that sensors like a camera can pick up and interpret the gesturing), can also be operated
               by more conventional user interface components.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>This criterion concerns input through sensors which respond directly to motions such
                  as gesturing towards, tilting or shaking a device. It does not cover the movement
                  of users through space as registered by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events
                  observed by the device other than intentional gesturing by the user. It also does
                  not cover incidental motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive
                  technology.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Devices often have sensors that can act as inputs, such as accelerometer and gyroscope
               sensors on a phone or tablet device. These sensors can allow the user to control something
               by simply changing the orientation or moving the device in particular ways. In other
               situations, web content can interpret user gestures via the camera or other sensors
               to actuate functions. For example, shaking the device might issue an "Undo" command,
               or a gentle hand wave might be used to move forward or backward in a sequence of pages.
               Some users with disabilities are not able to operate these device sensors (either
               not at all, or not precisely enough) because the device is on a fixed mount (perhaps
               a wheelchair) or due to motor impairments. Therefore, functionality offered through
               motion must also be available by another mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, some users may accidentally activate sensors due to tremors or other
               motor impairments. The user must have the ability to turn off motion actuation to
               prevent such accidental triggering of functions. Applications may be able to meet
               this requirement by supporting operating system settings which allow the user to disable
               motion detection at the system level.
            </p>
            <p>There is an exception where motion is essential for the function or not using motions
               or gestures would invalidate the activity. Some applications are specifically created
               to use device sensor data. Examples of content that are exempt from this requirement
               include a pedometer that relies on device motion to count steps.

               <li>This Success Criterion helps people who may be unable to perform particular motions
                  (such as tilting, shaking, or gesturing) because the device may be mounted or users
                  may be physically unable to perform the necessary movement. This success criterion
                  ensures that users can still operate all functionality by other means such as touch
                  or via assistive technologies.
