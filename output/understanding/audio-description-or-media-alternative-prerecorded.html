            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide people who are blind or visually
               impaired access to the visual information in a synchronized media presentation. This
               Success Criterion describes two approaches, either of which can be used.
               
            </p>
            <p>One approach is to provide audio description of the video content. The audio description
               augments the audio portion of the presentation with the information needed when the
               video portion is not available. During existing pauses in dialogue, audio description
               provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text
               that  are important and are not described or spoken in the main sound track.
               
            </p>
            <p>The second approach involves providing all of the information in the synchronized
               media (both visual and auditory) in text form. An alternative for time-based media
               provides a running description of all that is going on in the synchronized media content.
               The alternative for time-based media reads something like a screenplay or book. Unlike
               audio description, the description of the video portion is not constrained to just
               the pauses in the existing dialogue. Full descriptions are provided of all visual
               information, including visual context, actions and expressions of actors, and any
               other visual material. In addition, non-speech sounds (laughter, off-screen voices,
               etc.) are described, and transcripts of all dialogue are included. The sequence of
               description and dialogue transcripts are the same as the sequence in the synchronized
               media itself. As a result, the alternative for time-based media can provide a much
               more complete representation of the synchronized media content than audio description
               alone.
               
            </p>
            <p>If there is any interaction as part of the synchronized media presentation (e.g.,
               "press now to answer the question") then the alternative for time-based media would
               provide hyperlinks or whatever is needed to provide the same functionality.

                  <p>
                     For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already
                     provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary. 
                     
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other. This is to give the author
                     some choice at the minimum conformance level, and to provide additional requirements
                     at higher levels. At Level A in Success Criterion 1.2.3, authors do have the choice
                     of providing either an audio description or a full text alternative. If they wish
                     to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio
                     description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3,
                     otherwise an additional requirement. At Level AAA under Success Criterion 1.2.8 they
                     must provide an extended text description. This is an additional requirement if both
                     1.2.3 and 1.2.5 were met by providing an audio description only. If 1.2.3 was met,
                     however, by providing a text description, and the 1.2.5 requirement for an audio description
                     was met, then 1.2.8 does not add new requirements.
