            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to have content authors present instructions
               or labels that identify the controls in a form so that users know what input data
               is expected. Instructions or labels may also specify data formats for fields especially
               if they are out of the customary formats or if there are specific rules for correct
               input. Content authors may also choose to make such instructions available to users
               only when the individual control has focus especially when instructions are long and
               verbose.
               
            </p>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is not to clutter the page with unnecessary information
               but to provide important cues and instructions that will benefit people with disabilities.
               Too much information or instruction can be just as harmful as too little.
               The goal is to make certain that enough information is provided for the user to accomplish
               the task without undue confusion or navigation.
               
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion does not require that labels or instructions be correctly marked
               up, 
               identified, or associated with their respective controls - this aspect is covered
               separately by
               <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1: Info and Relationships</a>. It is possible for content
               to pass this Success Criterion (providing relevant labels and instructions) while
               failing
               Success Criterion 1.3.1 (if the labels or instructions aren't correctly marked up,
               identified, or associated).
               
            </p>
            <p>Further, this Success Criterion does not take into consideration whether or not alternative
               methods of
               providing an accessible name or description for form controls and inputs has been
               used - this aspect is
               covered separately by <a href="name-role-value">4.1.2: Name, Role and Value</a>. It is possible
               for controls and inputs to have an appropriate accessible name or description (e.g.
               using <code>aria-label="..."</code>)
               and therefore pass Success Criterion 4.1.2, but to still fail this Success Criterion
               (if the labels or instructions
               aren't presented to all users, not just those using assistive technologies).
               
            </p>
            <p>While this Success Criterion requires that controls and inputs have labels, whether
               or not
               these labels are sufficiently clear or descriptive is covered separately by
               <a href="headings-and-labels">2.4.6: Headings and Labels</a>.

               <li>Providing clear and unambiguous labels and instructions (including examples of expected

                  learning

                  of required
                  fields) can prevent users from making incomplete or incorrect form submissions, which
                  prevents
                  users from having to navigate once more through a page/form in order to fix submission
                  errors.

            <ul>
               
               
               <li>A field which requires the user to enter the two character abbreviation for a US state
                  has a link next to it which will popup an alphabetized list of state names and the
                  correct abbreviation.
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>A field for entering a date contains initial text which indicates the correct format
                  for the date.
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>A field for entering a given name is clearly labeled with "Given Name" and the field
                  for family name is labeled "Family Name" to avoid confusion over which name is requested.
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>A U.S. phone number separates the area code, exchange, and number into three fields.
                  Parentheses surround the area code field, and a dash separates the exchange and number
                  fields. While the punctuation provides visual clues to those familiar with the U.S.
                  telephone number format, the punctuation is not sufficient to label the fields. The
                  single "Phone number" label also cannot label all three fields. To address this, the
                  three fields are grouped in a fieldset with the legend "Phone number". Visual labels
                  for
                  the fields (beyond the punctuation) cannot be provided
                  in the design, so invisible labels are provided with the "title" attribute to each
                  of the three fields. The value of this attribute for the three fields are, respectively,
                  "Area Code", "Exchange", and "Number".

                  the
                  optional fields are clearly labeled as such.
