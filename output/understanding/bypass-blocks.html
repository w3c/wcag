            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow people who navigate sequentially
               through content more direct access to the primary content of the Web page. Web pages
               and applications often have content that appears on other pages or screens. Examples
               of repeated blocks of content include but are not limited to navigation links, heading
               graphics, and advertising frames. Small repeated sections such as individual words,
               phrases or single links are not considered blocks for the purposes of this provision.
               
               
               
            </p>
            <p>This is in contrast to a sighted user's ability to ignore the repeated material either
               by focusing on the center of the screen (where main content usually appears) or a
               mouse user's ability to select a link with a single mouse click rather than encountering
               every link or form control that comes before the item they want.
               
            </p>
            <p>It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require authors to provide methods
               that are redundant to functionality provided by the user agent. Most web browsers
               provide keyboard shortcuts to move the user focus to the top of the page, so if a
               set of navigation links is provided at the bottom of a web page providing a "skip"
               link may be unnecessary.
               
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  
                  <p>Although this Success Criterion deals with blocks of content that are repeated on
                     multiple pages, we also strongly promote structural markup on individual pages as
                     per Success Criteria 1.3.1.
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
               </div>
            </div>
            <p>Although the success criterion does not specifically use the term “within a set of
               web pages”, the concept of the pages belonging to a set is implied.  An author would
               not be expected to avoid any possible duplication of content in any two pages that
               are not in some way related to each other;  that are not "Web pages that share a common
               purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization” (the definition
               of set of web pages).
               
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>

                  <p>Even for web pages that are not in a set, if a web page has blocks of text that are
                     repeated within the page it may be helpful (but not required) to provide a means to
                     skip over them.

                  a link in the main content area. This can take a long time and may cause severe physical
                  pain for some users.

                  is a link at the top of the page that jumps to the main story. Without using this
                  link, a keyboard user needs to tab through approximately 40 links to reach the main
                  story; the screen reader user has to listen to 200 words; and the screen magnifier
                  user must search around for the location of the main body.
