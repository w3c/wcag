            <a href="#dfn-style-property">style properties</a>, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by
            changing no other style property:
         </p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;</li>

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion (SC) is to ensure that people can override author
               specified text spacing to improve their reading experience. Each of the requirements
               stipulated in the SC's four bullets helps ensure text styling can be adapted by the
               user to suit their needs.
            </p>
            <p>The specified metrics set a minimum baseline. The values in between the author's metrics
               and the metrics specified in this SC should not have loss of content or functionality.
            </p>
            <p>This SC focuses on the ability to increase spacing between lines, words, letters,
               and paragraphs. Any combination of these may assist a user with effectively reading
               text. As well, ensuring users can override author settings for spacing also significantly
               increases the likelihood other style preferences can be set by the user. For example,
               a user may need to change to a wider font family than the author has set in order
               to effectively read text. 
            </p>
            <section id="author-responsibility-">
               
               <h3>Author Responsibility </h3>
               
               <p>This SC does not dictate that authors must set all their content to the specified
                  metrics. Rather, it specifies that an author's content has the ability to be set to
                  those metrics without loss of content or functionality. The author requirement is
                  both to not interfere with a user's ability to override the author settings, and to
                  ensure that content thus modified does not break content in the manners shown in figures
                  1 through 3 in Effects of Not Allowing for Spacing Override. The values in the SC
                  are a baseline. Authors are encouraged to surpass the values specified, not see them
                  as a ceiling to build to. If the user chooses to go beyond the metrics specified any
                  resulting loss of content or functionality is the user's responsibility.
               </p>

                  <h4>Applicability</h4>
                  
                  <p>If the markup-based technologies being used are capable of overriding text to the
                     Success Criterion's metrics, then this SC is applicable. For instance Cascading Style
                     Sheet/HTML technologies are quite able to allow for the specified spacing metrics.
                     Plugin technologies would need to have a built-in ability to modify styles to the
                     specified metrics. Currently, this SC does not apply to PDF as it is not implemented
                     using markup.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Examples of text that are typically not affected by <a href="#dfn-style-property">style properties</a> and not expected to adapt are:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Video captions embedded directly into the video frames and not provided as an associated
                        caption file
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><a href="#dfn-image-of-text">Images of text</a></li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>For this SC, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element">canvas</a> implementations of text are considered to be <a href="#dfn-image-of-text">images of text</a>.

               <h3>User Responsibility</h3>
               
               <p>The ability to read and derive meaning from the overridden spacing rests with the
                  user. The user may choose to exceed the spacing adjustments in the SC. If the increased
                  spacing causes loss of content or functionality, the user will adjust or return to
                  the author’s original spacing or spacing within the bounds of the SC. Regardless,
                  the user needs the flexibility to adjust spacing within the bounds set in the SC without
                  loss of content or functionality. Such changes may be achieved via user stylesheet,
                  bookmarklet, extension, or application.
