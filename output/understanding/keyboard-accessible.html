            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>If all 
               <a href="#dfn-functionality">functionality</a> can be achieved using the keyboard, it can be accomplished by keyboard users, by
               speech input (which creates keyboard input), by mouse (using on-screen keyboards),
               and by a wide variety of assistive technologies that create simulated keystrokes as
               their output. No other input form has this flexibility or is universally supported
               and operable by people with different disabilities, as long as the keyboard input
               is not time-dependent.
               
            </p>
            <p>Note that providing universal keyboard input does not mean that other types of input
               should not be supported. Optimized speech input, optimized mouse/pointer input, etc.,
               are also good. The key is to provide keyboard input and control as well.
               
            </p>
            <p>Some devices do not have native keyboards—for example, a PDA or cell phone. If these
               devices have a Web browsing capability, however, they will have some means of generating
               text or "keystrokes". This guideline uses the term "
               <a href="#dfn-keyboard-interface">keyboard interface</a>" to acknowledge that Web content should be controlled from keystrokes that may come
               from a keyboard, keyboard emulator, or other hardware or software that generates keyboard
               or text input.

                           as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface
                           to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications
                           that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text
                           applications with "keyboard emulation" functionality.

                        mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard
                        interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface,
                        not through its keyboard interface.
