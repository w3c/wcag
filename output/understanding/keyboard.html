            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that, wherever possible, content
               can be operated through a keyboard or keyboard interface (so an alternate keyboard
               can be used). When content can be operated through a keyboard or alternate keyboard,
               it is operable by people with no vision (who cannot use devices such as mice that
               require eye-hand coordination) as well as by people who must use alternate keyboards
               or input devices that act as keyboard emulators. Keyboard emulators include speech
               input software, sip-and-puff software, on-screen keyboards, scanning software and
               a variety of assistive technologies and alternate keyboards. Individuals with low
               vision also may have trouble tracking a pointer and find the use of software much
               easier (or only possible) if they can control it from the keyboard.
               
            </p>
            <p>Examples of "specific timings for individual keystrokes" include situations where
               a user would be required to repeat or execute multiple keystrokes within a short period
               of time or where a key must be held down for an extended period before the keystroke
               is registered. 
               
               
            </p>
            <p>The phrase "except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the
               path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints" is included to separate those
               things that cannot reasonably be controlled from a keyboard.
               
            </p>
            <p>Most actions carried out by a pointing device can also be done from the keyboard (for
               example, clicking, selecting, moving, sizing). However, there is a small class of
               input that is done with a pointing device that cannot be done from the keyboard in
               any known fashion without requiring an inordinate number of keystrokes. Free hand
               drawing, watercolor painting, and flying a helicopter through an obstacle course are
               all examples of functions that require path dependent input. Drawing straight lines,
               regular geometric shapes, re-sizing windows and dragging objects to a location (when
               the path to that location is not relevant) do not require path dependent input.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>The use of MouseKeys would not satisfy this Success Criterion because it is not a
               keyboard equivalent to the application; it is a mouse equivalent (i.e., it looks like
               a mouse to the application).
               
            </p>
            <p>It is assumed that the design of user input features takes into account that operating
               system keyboard accessibility features may be in use. For example, modifier key locking
               may be turned on. Content continues to function in such an environment, not sending
               events that would collide with the modifier key lock to produce unexpected results.
