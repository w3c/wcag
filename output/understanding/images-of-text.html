            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage authors, who are using technologies
               which are capable of achieving their desired default visual presentation, to enable
               people who require a particular visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the
               text presentation as needed. This includes people who require the text in a particular
               font size, foreground and background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.
               
            </p>
            <p>If an author can use text to achieve the same visual effect, he or she should present
               the information as text rather than using an image. If for any reason, the author
               cannot format the text to get the same effect, the effect won't be reliably presented
               on the commonly available user agents, or using a technology to meet this criterion
               would interfere with meeting other criteria such as 1.4.4, then an image of text can
               be used. This includes instances where a particular presentation of text is essential
               to the information being conveyed, such as type samples, logotypes, branding, etc.
               Images of text may also be used in order to use a particular font that is either not
               widely deployed or which the author doesn't have the right to redistribute, or to
               ensure that the text would be anti-aliased on all user agents.
               
            </p>
            <p>Images of text can also be used where it is possible for users to customize the image
               of text to match their requirements.
               
            </p>
            <p>The definition of image of text contains the note: Note: This does not include text
               that is part of a picture that contains significant
               other visual content. Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams
               which visually
               convey important information through more than just text.
               
            </p>
            <p>Techniques for satisfying this Success Criterion are the same as those for Success
               Criterion 1.4.9, except that they only need to apply if the visual presentation can
               be achieved with the technologies that the author is using. For Success Criterion
               1.4.9, the sufficient techniques would be applied only when the user can customize
               the output.

                     the quote with 1.5x the line space and further indented from the left margin. CSS
                     is used to position the text; set the spacing between lines; as well as display the

                     text characters that do not form a sequence that expresses something in human language.
                     For example "B" to increase font weight, "I" to italicize the text and "ABC" to check
                     the spelling. The symbolic text characters are included as gif images which do not
