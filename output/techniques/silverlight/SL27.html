                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to use the combination of HTML
                     				<code class="att">Lang</code> attribute, <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> and <code class="prop">Language</code> to
                     				correctly specify the language of the entirety of Silverlight content,
                     				or of parts within the Silverlight content. 
                  </p>
                  <p>In general, Silverlight does not attempt to repurpose HTML Lang, because
                     				Silverlight is not HTML. Instead, internally within the Silverlight
                     				content area, Silverlight uses language definition concepts that relate
                     				to XML (<code class="prop">Language</code> is a remapping of xml:lang) or .NET
                     				Framework programming (<code class="obj">CultureInfo</code>). For these reasons,
                     				HTML Lang techniques as described in [<a href="/techniques/html/H58">H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language </a>]
                     				are not useful for Silverlight programming of Silverlight-specific "parts". 
                  </p>
                  <p>What becomes important in Silverlight application programming then
                     				is to make sure that the HTML language concept of Lang and the Silverlight
                     				language concept of CultureInfo or Lang are not at odds with one another,
                     				or reporting misinformation. In particular, application authors should
                     				avoid situations where an assistive technology has HTML Lang available
                     				for programmatic determination of either page or part, but the effective
                     				runtime language in the Silverlight part is different. The result here
                     				might be that a screen reader that changes functionality such as phonetic
                     				pronunciations would not correctly read the text content from the Silverlight
                     				content. Avoiding this situation is largely a matter of due diligence
                     				on the part of a Silverlight application author, OR on the part of
                     				the Web page author who authors surrounding HTML, in cases where a
                     				Web page is embedding Silverlight content or packages that the Web
                     				page's author did not actively develop and is only consuming/embedding. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The following is a general recommendation that summarizes the detailed
                     				discussion in subsequent subheadings: 
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li> If the Silverlight application does not have a strong emphasis
                        				on presenting textual information with a particular language association,
                        				HTML Lang should be left blank. This causes assistive technologies
                        				to defer to either user agent or platform language settings. Silverlight
                        				is able to determine these same language values at run time, and
                        				language behavior of assistive technologies and of Silverlight is
                        				kept synchronized through the use of the same external information
                        				set. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> If the Silverlight application DOES have a strong emphasis on
                        					presenting textual information with A SINGLE particular language
                        					association, HTML Lang should be assigned to report that specific
                        					language either for whole page or at least for the Silverlight object
                        					tag. This enables assistive technologies to pick up the value, per <a href="/techniques/html/H57">H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element</a>. Aside from
                        					due diligence during development and deployment, Silverlight application
                        					code might choose to enforce that its runtime CultureInfo is really
                        					the same. This could be addressed with a specific HTML DOM helper
                        					function. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> If the Silverlight application has MULTIPLE language associations,
                        						the best option is to separate the Silverlight application into object
                        						parts at the HTML level, to assure that HTML Lang and intended runtime
                        						language do not clash. This is particularly important if the application
                        						is actively resetting CurrentCulture away from the user settings
                        						of platform or user agent. For more information, see <a href="#SL4"></a>. 
                     </li>

                     <h3> HTML Lang </h3>
                     
                     <p>When Silverlight is embedded in an HTML document with the   &lt;object&gt; element,
                        					the value of the HTML <code class="att">Lang</code> attribute of the surrounding HTML becomes
                        					a factor. Browsers process the outer HTML, and the browser's processing
                        					has possible influence over values reported to any DOM script that
                        					acts, or to any accessibility framework that is reporting the browser
                        					content. The preferred way for a Silverlight application to address <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page">SC
                           						3.1.1</a> is to correctly specify the HTML Lang value in the hosting
                        					HTML page. This technique should be used in conjunction with <a href="/techniques/html/H57">H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element</a>. By using the
                        					same language values with both techniques as a better practice, H57
                        					will satisfy 3.1.1 while setting the language value of the Silverlight
                        					content to match will assist authors in meeting SC 3.1.2. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The Silverlight runtime itself does not attempt to inherit language
                        					settings that come from markup that is outside the Silverlight-specific
                        					content. In particular, the HTML <code class="att">Lang</code> attribute applied to the html
                        					tag, Lang on host object tag, specific parameters of the Silverlight
                        					object tag, all have no affect on the value of any Silverlight <code class="prop">Language</code> attribute.
                        					Instead, the Silverlight <code class="prop">Language</code> defaults to the <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> of
                        					the Silverlight runtime as instantiated by HTML object tag invocation.
                        					It is expected that if a Silverlight application contains extensive
                        					text where language of text is a factor for assistive technology purposes,
                        					developers will manually set the HTML Lang tag to match the <code class="prop">Language</code> value
                        					on the Silverlight root element in XAML. Development tools might or
                        					might not enforce or inform the relationship between HTML Lang and
                        					Silverlight <code class="prop">Language</code>; that consideration is outside
                        					the scope of Silverlight as a technology. If language is not a major
                        					factor in the application, application authors should consider leaving
                        					HTML Lang blank on the hosting HTML page. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can programatically determine the value of HTML Lang of surrounding
                        					HTML from within the Silverlight API, by using the DOM-bridging method <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.browser.htmlelement.getattribute%28VS.95%29.aspx">HtmlElement.GetAttribute</a>.
                        					Otherwise, this can be determined by techniques other than Silverlight's
                        					(such as scripting to the HTML DOM of the hosting browser).

                        <code class="prop">Language</code> is an attribute that is available on all
                        					Silverlight objects that directly represent a UI element. Language
                        					can be queried (or set) by Silverlight managed code run time, such
                        					that the <code class="prop">Language</code> value can be programatically determined
                        					within the Silverlight programming model. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The format of the value that is used to set <code class="prop">Language</code> is
                        					based on ISO-639-1, and is thus compatible with <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt</a>. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>
                        <code class="prop">Language</code> has a behavior that parallels the behavior
                        					of <code class="att">xml:lang</code> in an XML document: if <code class="prop">Language</code> is set on
                        					a parent element, all child elements inherit that <code class="prop">Language</code> value.
                        					An actual <code class="att">xml:lang</code> attribute in XAML is also valid for this purpose. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>
                        <code class="prop">Language</code> can be set at the root of a XAML document,
                        					so that the entire UI shares the same language setting. If <code class="prop">Language</code> is
                        					not explicitly set at the root by application markup, <code class="prop">Language</code> is
                        					inferred per running instance, based on processing the acting <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> at
                        					run time. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>However, another usage is for application authors to set <code class="prop">Language</code> on
                        					a specific child element, to override the root-level or client-environment-inferred
                        <code class="prop">Language</code> value.
                        					This enables consciously embedding a content part that is deliberately
                        					in a different language than the remainder of the Silverlight content. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Exactly what happens when a <code class="prop">Language</code> is set on a
                        					part is not always specified, and is largely a matter of implementation
                        					detail of the individual Silverlight classes that might be a "part".
                        					However, as an informative generalization, the value of <code class="prop">Language</code> might
                        					affect considerations such as: how white space is processed (in particular
                        					CR or LF); character sets for fonts; string formatting when using APIs
                        					specifically on that part.

                     <p>
                        <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> is a concept that is relevant to .NET
                        					Framework programming. This concept applies to Silverlight because
                        					Silverlight uses a specific implementation of a CLR runtime that uses
                        					.NET Framework principles. <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> potentially
                        					specifies both a language and a culture. This distinction becomes relevant
                        					for advanced string formatting concepts that are provided in the .NET
                        					Framework, such as decimal separators, dates, and currency. For example,
                        					an application author might simply specify "en" if the author
                        					did not care about string formatting, but might specify "en-GB" if
                        					the application was using string formatting for currency values with
                        					the intention of displaying Pounds Sterling as currency unit in string

                     <p>Silverlight applications often run using an inferred <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> based
                        					on the operating system where the user agent browser host exists (in
                        					other words, the culture of the client computer where the Silverlight
                        					application is run). This <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> can be queried
                        					by applications at run time; see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture%28VS.95%29.aspx">CultureInfo.CurrentCulture</a>.
                        					Application authors can deliberately constrain the set of <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> cases
                        					that a Silverlight application can be run under, in order to verify
                        					that necessary string resources for that culture are available in that
                        					application. This is done by setting &lt;SupportedCultures&gt; in the
                        					Silverlight project settings. If a user accesses the application on
                        					a client that is outside the SupportedCultures, the application author
                        					has the following choices: 
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li> Use a fallback resource set representing a neutral culture; this
                           					is enabled automatically by the Silverlight resources lookup behavior,
                           					so long as the project includes resources identified as being culture-neutral.
                           					This is the preferred approach. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> Use client logic to detect the culture, and initiate a client-side
                           						redirect to request either a different XAP or a different hosting
                           						HTML page. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> Trap requests at the server level by checking lang request in
                           							the header. This varies between server implementations, is not a
                           							Silverlight-specific technique, and is not discussed here. 
                        </li>

                     <p>
                        <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> generally applies to the Silverlight
                        					application as a whole. There are advanced techniques whereby worker
                        					threads can be run as separate cultures, but that is not discussed
                        					here and is not relevant because only the main UI thread has relevance
                        					to Web content accessibility. So, if an application author wants to
                        					declare specific language settings for a part (component, region or
                        					control) of the Silverlight application, a different Silverlight-specific
                        					property <code class="prop">Language</code> is used.
