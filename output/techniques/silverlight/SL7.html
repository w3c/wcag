                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to build custom visual states for
                     				custom controls that include visible focus indicators in the templates
                     				and parts. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The default Silverlight core controls all indicate some type of visible
                     				focus indication, through their default templates. For more information
                     				on how Silverlight controls will generally supply a default visual
                     				focus indicator, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc903954(VS.95).aspx">Focus
                        					Overview on MSDN</a>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Silverlight control skinning is enabled through a deliberate separation
                     				of visible user interface design and control logic in the Silverlight
                     				control model. Control authors expect that application authors might
                     				reskin their control. But control authors should provide an initial
                     				default set of states, templates, etc. so that application authors
                     				have a good baseline of functionality to compare with their customization.
                     				Defining visible focus states for all control parts is an example of
                     				such baseline functionality. In order to make the visual focus state
                     				customizable, the visual state should be associated with a name. Ideally
                     				that name should have a human-readable meaning that hints at its purpose,
                     				but the real reason for the name is that it connects the XAML-defined
                     				template (which control consumers can change) with the control logic
                     				defined by the control author (which control consumers cannot change).
                     				Also, the visual names and groups in the XAML should be attributed
                     				on the control class, to assist design tools. The best resource for
                     				general information about Silverlight control customization is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278064%28v=VS.95%29.aspx">Silverlight

                     <h3>Component Parts</h3>
                     
                     <p>Some controls are created by assembling various component parts that
                        					are already defined as controls either by the Silverlight run time
                        					libraries or by third parties. That scenario is not really what this
                        					technique is about, because in that case the focus behavior is already
                        					defined by the component's template, and the control author can re-use
                        					that behavior as-is or reskin it but still through the same named state
                        					definition. This technique specifically addresses how to define a control
                        					where the interactive surface has mouse and keyboard handling defined
                        					at a lower level for the control as a whole. The actual focus region
                        					is defined by the control author in that case, and the focus indicator
                        					is also defined to match the behavior visually and functionally.

                     <h3>Design for Focus Indicators</h3>
                     
                     <p>The general design principles for visual focus indicators are that
                        					the indicators should apply a visual change to the focus region's exterior
                        					margin. A common pattern is to deliberately define the visuals for
                        					the control with a pre-existing blank margin for its layout slot; that
                        					way when the focus indicator is applied, the focus indicator can fill
                        					that margin. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The actual graphic for the visual focus indicator is typically a border
                        					or shaped frame of a solid color brush with at least 1 pixel line thickness.
                        					The color used for the border stands out visually from the underlying
                        					control background or other elements of the control. The contrast between
                        					brush for visual focus and the remainder of control should be a contrast
                        					difference that is visible to users who do not distinguish the hue
                        					of colors, but can distinguish the lightness/value. In many cases the
                        					border is rectangular, to go along with the control's layout slot.
                        					However, if the control's basic shape is a non-rectangular shape, sometimes
                        					the focus indicator is designed to make a border around that shape.
                        					An example of a default Silverlight control that is round and applies
                        					an exterior round border as a focus indicator is a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.radiobutton%28VS.95%29.aspx">RadioButton</a>. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Most focus indicator designs change only the border and do not change
                        					the main area of the control. One reason for this is that changes to
                        					the main control are typically reserved for other interactive states
                        					that also have a visual indicator. Specifically, controls need a visual
                        					state that indicates that the mouse is over the control (this is termed
                        					either MouseOver or Hover state). Controls that support activation
                        					also have a visual state that provides feedback for activation. For
                        					example, the default Silverlight <code class="obj">RepeatButton</code> changes
                        					its <code class="prop">Background</code> gradient on the button field to be
                        					darker blue value when the mouse is over the button, and changes to
                        					an even darker value blue when the button is activated (either by clicking
                        					the mouse or by pressing SPACE or ENTER with keyboard focus on the <code class="obj">RepeatButton</code>).
                        					To see this behavior in a live sample, see <a href="http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/Silverlight/SampleBrowser/index.htm#/?sref=System.Windows.Controls.RepeatButtonEx">RepeatButton

                     <h3>Logic for Focus Indicators</h3>
                     
                     <p>Typical logic is that the border to indicate focus is present in the
                        					default template design, but with an initial value of Visibility=Collapsed.
                        					Then, a visual state for focus is defined with a name that properly
                        					indicates its purpose as text (example: "Focused"). In addition,
                        					a state is needed that undoes whatever changes were applied for focus,
                        					once focus moves to another element (for example,   "Unfocused").
                        					For example, if the "Focused" state sets the value Visibility=Visible
                        					on some element, the "Unfocused" state sets that value to
                        					Collapsed again. Silverlight's visual state system also provides a
                        					way to group related states with a factoring name (for example, "FocusStates").
                        					For more information on state names and state groups in Silverlight
                        					visual states, as well as learning how these states define a control
                        					contract that any control consumers should follow if they reskin that
                        					control, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189093(VS.95).aspx">Customizing
                           						the Appearance of an Existing Control by Using a ControlTemplate on
                           						MSDN</a>. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The visual state system is designed to support visual transitions
                        					to states, and for that reason the visual state system is closely coupled
                        					with the Silverlight animation system. By animating the transition,
                        					the visual appearance changes over a time interval. Typically, if transitions
                        					are used, the time interval is short, one second or less. In the case
                        					of focus indicators, it is typical to not use transitions and to instead
                        					make a discrete change; otherwise, the state change might be interpreted
                        					by users as a lag in interface response from their system. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The states themselves are designed in XAML, but are loaded and unloaded
                        					through logic that the control author defines as part of their control
                        					code. The control author does this by handling the appropriate events
                        					that occur while the event scope applies to their control. For example,
                        					to apply the "Focused" state, the control author handles
                        					the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.uielement.gotfocus%28VS.95%29.aspx">GotFocus
                           						event</a>. Rather than handle the event directly, the more common pattern
                        					is to override a virtual method that acts as a prewired event handler, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.ongotfocus%28v=VS.95%29.aspx">OnGotFocus</a>.
                        					The centralized logic for visual state changes is the method <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd991369%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">GoToState</a>,

                        					correct state to load from the XAML templates. Examples for all of
                        					the APIs discussed here are available in the MSDN topic <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278064(VS.95).aspx">Creating

                     <h3>Focus in Silverlight</h3>
                     
                     <p>Focus in Silverlight is equivalent to the larger user interface and
                        					application concept of keyboard focus. The element that has focus is
                        					the element within the Silverlight object tree and programming model
                        					that has first chance to process the Silverlight key events. As a more
                        					tangible example that is user-centric, if a <code class="obj">TextBox</code> has
                        					keyboard focus, then when the user presses keys on the keyboard, the
                        					characters associated with the user's pressed keys (or possibly input
                        					that is enabled by an assistive technology that can substitute for
                        					key strokes) will appear in the <code class="obj">TextBox</code>. A user interface
                        					element in Silverlight can obtain keyboard focus in one of three ways: 
                     </p>
                     
                     <ol>
                        
                        <li> The user uses the Silverlight tab sequence to traverse into the
                           					Silverlight content and to focus a specific control. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> The Silverlight application's logic calls the Focus() method programmatically
                           						to force focus to a control.

                        <li> The user performs some other action, for example uses the mouse
                           							to click on a control. That control's specific logic handles the
                           							Silverlight input event and uses that event as stimulus to call Focus()
                           							on that control. The difference between this case and the above case
                           							is that the behavior is typically built-in to that control's runtime
                           							behavior, and does not require each application author to call Focus()
                           							in application code.

                        						template. This control is simple: it has a yellow circle graphic, which
                        						overlays a red circle edge when the control is focused. The circle
                        						edge is defined by the "FocusVisual" element in the composition,
                        						and is initially Visibility=Collapsed (the expected visual state prior
                        						to being focused).
