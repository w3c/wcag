                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to use some of the basic user interface
                     				objects in Silveright to produce blocks of content that are identified
                     				as a "List" to accessibility frameworks and to Silverlight's
                     				own tab sequence navigation behavior. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Using the "List" technique results in a tab sequence behavior
                     				whereby that element is treated as a single tab stop, even if that
                     				element has consituent elements (the list items) that would otherwise
                     				be considered additional tab stops in the main tab sequence. In the
                     				default key handling, when the user presses the TAB key while focus
                     				is on a List, the focus goes to the next element after the List. To
                     				focus the items of the list, the user would press the Arrow keys rather
                     				than TAB. In the Silverlight programming model for controls, this tab
                     				sequence behavior is expressed by the <code class="prop">TabNavigation</code> property
                     				holding the value of <code class="prop">Once</code>. The Silverlight <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</a> is
                     				a control that reports itself as "List" role, and that has
                     				a default <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.tabnavigation%28VS.95%29.aspx">TabNavigation.Once</a> value.
                     				Thus <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</a> as
                     				per this technique is a lightweight technique for producing blocks
                     				that can be bypassed. It is specifically a lightweight technique because
                     				it can be accomplished by writing simple application-level XAML and
                     				using only the Silverlight core libraries. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Silverlight also supports more full-featured techniques for producing
                     				bypass blocks that are based on common user interface features such
                     				as menus or toolbars. However, using toolbars in Silverlight is inherently
                     				not as lightweight because the Silverlight core libraries themselves
                     				do not include a ready-made toolbar. Silverlight provides a <code class="obj">ContextMenu</code> as
                     				part of the Silverlight Toolkit extensions, but the behavior of this
                     				particular menu does not easily address the bypass block scenario.
                     				Silverlight includes all the infrastructure and necessary base classes
                     				for defining a toolbar or a menu that could address the bypass block
                     				scenario. Many third-party control implementations of menus and toolbars
                     				exist, either as part of control packages that are sold by control
                     				vendors, or through community mechanisms such as CodePlex or third-party
                     				sites that provide free source code. For some examples, see the following:

                  </ul>
                  <p>If application authors use a built-in control such as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</a> where
                     				the accessibility framework reported role is not traditionally associated
                     				with a navigation role, it is a best practice to set <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> such
                     				that the name informs the user of the purpose of the list control.
                     				Otherwise, the role alone leaves this ambiguous. For example, an author
                     				might name the list control "Navigation control". 
                  </p>
                  <p>Often the List control itself is focusable. So long as the List control
                     				has a visual focus indicator, that behavior might be acceptable. However,
                     				it might provide a better user experience to deliberately have the
                     				List itself non-focusable, and instead have focus fall to the first
                     				List item when focus reaches that region. Otherwise, the List might
                     				be perceived as an "extra" tab stop to some users. To enable
                     				that behavior, set <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.istabstop%28VS.95%29.aspx">IsTabStop</a> to
                     				false on the List control. The List itself still provides the intended
                     				tab navigation behavior, and is still reported and identified to accessibility
                     				frameworks and assistive technologies, even when the List container
                     				is not focusable. This is shown in Example 1, by setting <code class="prop">IsTabStop</code> as
                     				part of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.style%28VS.95%29.aspx">Style</a>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>When an accessibility framework presents a List, assistive technologies
                     				are generally expected to continue to support use of the same key behavior
                     				as the default behavior, and to report to users that the item is a
                     				List when it is focused. If assistive technologies use the accessibility
                     				framework APIs for navigation, the items in the list are considered
                     				child elements. Navigating either by spatial direction (e.g. NAVDIR_RIGHT
                     				in MSAA) or sequential direction (e.g. NAVDIR_NEXT in MSAA) skips the
                     				list items and goes to the spatial/next peer.

                     <h3>Example 1: Customize the behavior and appearance of a ListBox to
                        					construct a navigation control that can be bypassed
                     </h3>
                     <p>In this example, several properties that influence the items presentation
                        						behavior of the Silverlight core control <code class="obj">ListBox</code> are
                        						adjusted to make it suitable for a navigation control. The behavior
                        						of this control is that when the tab sequence reaches the control,   "next"
                        or
                        						spatial navigation continues on to other controls, rather than through
                        						the child controls of the list's items/options. This is enabled and
                        						properly reported because <code class="obj">ListBox</code> reports its accessibility
                        						framework role as "List", uses <code class="prop">TabNavigation</code> = Once as
                        						default (because it is the default, <code class="prop">TabNavigation</code> does not have to
                        						be set explicitly in the markup). <code class="obj">ListBox</code> has default
                        						key handling for the arrow keys (to enable traversing the choices in
                        						the menu by keyboard-only). The control could also be visually a menu
                        						or perhaps other user interface control metaphors, depending on how
                        						it is visually templated and composited. Regardless of appearance,
                        						the accessibility framework and any assistive technologies based on
                        						that framework will treat the control as a "List". This example
                        						is templated as a horizontally oriented toolbar-type control. The items
                        						in this example are <code class="obj">Button</code> controls, but could be
                        						templated to not appear quite as button-like, or could instead use
                        						another focusable control for the items such as a read-only <code class="obj">TextBox</code>.

                        </li>
                        
                        <li> Press TAB key to traverse typical tab sequence within the Silverlight
                           						application. Verify that common areas in the user interface composition
                           						("blocks") that are reporting the List role per this technique
                           						can be bypassed without having to tab through each constituent part
                           						(the "items/children" of the List). 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> Verify that the list children are still accessible by keyboard,
                           							by using ARROW keys rather than TAB. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> Engage an accessibility framework test tool such as UIAVerify.
                           								Examine roles in the automation tree, and verify that the List used
                           								for bypass behavior reports a combination of name+role that is consistent
                           								with the behavior. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> Use a screen reader to verify that name and role are reported
                           									properly. 
                        </li>
