                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a checkbox that users must select to
                     indicate they have reviewed their input and are ready for it to be committed. This
                     is important when the nature of the transaction is such that it may not be reversible
                     if input errors are subsequently discovered or when the result of an action is that
                     data is deleted. The author provides a checkbox that is not selected when the page
                     loads, with a label like "I confirm that the input is correct and am ready to submit"
                     or "I confirm that I wish to delete this data". The checkbox should be located near
                     the submit button to help the user notice it during the submission process. If the
                     checkbox is not selected when the form is submitted, the input is rejected and the
                     user is prompted to review their entry, select the checkbox, and resubmit. Only if
                     the checkbox is selected will the input be accepted and the transaction processed.
                  </p>
                  <p>This checkbox helps to guard against the consequences of an accidental form submission,
                     and also serves to prompt the user to be sure they have entered accurate data. This
                     is more secure than simply putting a label on the submit button like "input is correct,
                     submit". Providing the checkbox as a separate control from the submit button forces
                     the user to "double-check", as they must both select the checkbox and activate the
                     submit button for the transaction to proceed. As such, this is a mechanism for reviewing,
                     confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.
                  </p>
                  <div class="note">

                     <div>
                        
                        <p>When users submit information without selecting the checkbox, they should not lose
                           the information that they have entered when they return to the form to resubmit.
                        </p>
                        
                     </div>

               <section id="examples">
                  <h2>Examples</h2>
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>An online bank service allows users to transfer money between accounts in different
                        currencies. Because exchange rates are constantly in flux, the money cannot be re-exchanged
                        at the same rate if the user discovers an error in their input after the transaction
                        has been carried out. In addition to the "account from", "account to", and "amount"
                        fields, there is a checkbox with a label "I have checked that the amount I wish to
                        transfer is correct". If this checkbox is not selected when the user submits the form,
                        the transaction is not carried out and the user is notified. If the checkbox is selected,
                        the (irreversible) transaction is carried out.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>An online payment system stores user bank account information in order to process
                        payments. There is an elaborate procedure for users to enter new accounts and verify
                        that they are the owner. There is the facility to delete old accounts, but if an account
                        is accidentally deleted, it would be difficult to reinstate it, and the transaction
                        history with that account would be lost. Therefore, on pages that allow users to delete
                        accounts, there is a checkbox with the label "I confirm that I wish to delete this
                        account." If this checkbox is not selected when the user submits the form, the account
                        is not deleted and the user is given an error message. Only if the checkbox is selected
                        is the account deleted.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>A checkout form on a shopping site includes a form that collects order, shipping and
                        billing information. After submitting the form, the user is taken to a page where
                        the information they have submitted is summarized for review. Below the summary, a
                        checkbox with the label "I have reviewed and confirmed that this data is correct"
                        is shown. The user must mark the checkbox and activate a "complete order" button in
                        order to complete the transaction.
                     </li>
