                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an easy way to pass the success criterion
                     for things that flash, but are small.
                  </p>
                  <p>If you have something that flashes
                     <em>more</em>
                     than 3 times in a one second period (so G19 can't be used), but the area that is flashing
                     is less than 25% of 10 degrees of visual field (which represents the central area
                     of vision in the eye), then it would automatically pass.
                  </p>
                  <p>The 10 degree of visual field represents the central area of vision in the eye. This
                     area is highly packed with visual sensors. Flashes in this area are transmitted to
                     the visual cortex. For those with photosensitivity, this flashing of activity on the
                     visual cortex can cause seizures. Flashing on other areas of the eye (which have far
                     fewer sensors) has much less effect on the cortex. Hence, the focus on just the 10
                     degrees of central vision.
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Most Web authors do not know how to translate visual field to pixels, which is what
                     they generally can deal with. This technique provides that translation.
                  </p>
                  <p>At this point in time, the most prevalent display is 1024 x 768 and about 15-17 inches
                     diagonally. When viewed at a typical viewing distance (22-26 inches) a 10 degree visual
                     field will capture an area approximately 341 x 256 pixels. This is not circular, but
                     neither is the central vision of most users, and the difference is so small (and at
                     the edge of the central vision where sensors are fewer) that it is not important.
                  </p>
                  <p>Since the criterion is 25% of any 10 degree visual field,
                     <strong>any single flashing event on a screen (there is no other flashing on screen) that
                        is smaller than a contiguous area of 21,824 sq pixels (any shape), would pass the
                        General and Red Flash Thresholds</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>1024 x 768 was chosen because it represents the most common screen size. It also works
                     with higher resolution screens since the tighter pixel density would result in a smaller
                     and safer image size.
                  </p>
                  <p>Users with lower resolution displays or that enlarge or view their screens closely
                     would have a higher risk depending on the viewing distance. To address the needs of
                     this group,
                     <a href="#G19"></a>
                     should be used since it is independent of screen resolution or viewing distance.

                           high. This has an area of 75 square degrees, vs the 78.5 square degree area of a true
