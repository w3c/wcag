                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may
                     not be able to discern a difference in text color. Color is commonly used to indicate
                     words that are links within a paragraph or other block of text. For example, scattered
                     words in text may be hypertext links that are identified only by a difference in color
                     with surrounding text. This technique describes a way to provide additional cues on
                     hover and focus so that users who may have difficulty perceiving color differences
                     or have low vision can identify them.
                  </p>
                  <p>With this technique, a
                     <a href="/guidelines/#" target="terms">relative luminance</a>
                     (lightness) difference of 3:1 or greater with the text around it can be used if additional
                     visual confirmation is available when a user points or tabs to the link. Visual highlights
                     may, for example, take the form of underline, a change in font style such as bold
                     or italics, or an increase in font size.
                  </p>
                  <p>While using this technique is sufficient to meet this success criteria, it is not
                     the preferred technique to differentiate link text. This is because links that use
                     the relative luminance of color alone may not be obvious to people with black/white
                     color blindness. If there are not a large number of links in the block of text, underlines
                     are recommended for links.
                  </p>
                  <div class="note">
                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <div>
                        
                        <p>This technique is about the use of color in addition to luminosity. In this technique,
                           the contrast ratio refers to the contrast between a link and the words around it.
                           In Success Criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast ratio refers to the contrast between
                           a word and its background. The difference is that  this technique is about the ability
                           for users to tell the difference (a noticeable difference) between different pieces
                           of text whereas the contrast ratio used in success criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 is about
                           the readability of the text with its background for different color and vision disabilities.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If an author wants to use the color portion of this technique (i.e., using different
                           colors for the words where the colors have sufficient contrast with each other) and
                           the author also wants to conform to SC 1.4.3 (contrast of both words with their backgrounds)
                           the following colors can be used. (e.g., black text in a paragraph on a white background
                           with the links shown as one of the colors in example 1 below.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If assistive technology or Web browsers at some point all provide an option to underline
                           all links on Web pages for users, this could be used instead of an author-provided
                           link highlighting mechanism.
