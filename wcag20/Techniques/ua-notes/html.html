              is to be displayed when the element cannot be rendered normally. User Agents will
              display the <code>alt</code> attribute text when images are not displayed. However,
              currently, visual User Agents do not display the <code>alt</code> attribute text for area elements
              of image maps when accessed by keyboard or when images are not displayed, and may clip
              the area elements if the intrinsic size of the image is not used. In addition, the
              display of <code>alt</code> attribute text in response to mouse-hover does not display in the font
              size or color combination set in the User Agent. </p><p>The <code>title</code> attribute is meant to provide additional information. However,
              current implementation in User Agents is access to either the title or <code>alt</code> attribute,
              but not both. User Agents generally will display the <code>title</code> attribute text
              when the mouse is placed over the element containing the <code>title</code> attribute.
              </p><p>Therefore, when using image maps, successful implementation of this technique would
              require either:</p><ul><li><p>Ensuring the area element <code>alt</code> attribute value is displayed in response to
                  attaining focus (including keyboard focus), and that this applies both to
                  situations where images are loaded and not loaded. OR</p></li><li><p>A redundant mechanism serving the same purpose as the area elements is present in
                  the Web Page.</p></li></ul></div></section><section id="H27"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H27.html">H27</a>: Providing text and non-text alternatives for object

The content of the <code>title</code> attribute needs to be available to all keyboard users (not only those with text-to-speech software) for this attribute to be accessibility  supported.</p></li><li><p>JAWS 6.2 and higher and WindowEyes 5.0 and higher support the abbr and acronym elements. They can all be set to speak the title attribute when these elements are encountered, but this is not the default setting and is often not turned on by users. </p></li><li><p>Many graphical user agents render text enclosed within an <code>abbr</code> or <code>acronym</code> element with a dotted line below or surrounding it. In addition, when the mouse hovers over the element, the expansion is displayed as a tool tip.
                      </p></li><li><p>In Internet Explorer 7 and below, items marked using the <code>abbr</code> element are not displayed with any additional formatting. For IE 6 and below, the expanded version does not display as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the item. </p></li><li><p>Within a given user agent or assistive technology, <code>abbr</code> and <code>acronym</code> elements are presented to users in the same way.
                      </p></li></ul></div></section><section id="H33"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H33.html">H33</a>: Supplementing link text with the title attribute</h2><div class="ua-issue"><ul><li><p> Current user agents and assistive technology provide no feedback to the user
                  when links have <code>title</code> attribute content available. </p></li><li><p> Some graphical user agents will display a tool tip when the mouse hovers above
                  an anchor element containing a <code>title</code> attribute. However, current user
                  agents do not provide access to <code>title</code> attribute content via the
                  keyboard. </p></li><li><p> The tool tip in some common user agents disappears after a short period of time
                  (approximately 5 seconds). This can cause difficulty accessing <code>title</code>
                  attribute content for those users who can use a mouse but have fine motor skill
                  impairment, and may result in difficulties for users who need more time to read
                  the tool tip. </p></li><li><p> Current graphical user agents do not provide mechanisms to control the
                  presentation of <code>title</code> attribute content. The user cannot resize the
                  tool tip text or control the foreground and background colors. The placement and
                  location of the tool tip cannot be controlled by users, causing some screen
                  magnifier users to be unable to access meaningful portions of the
                  <code>title</code> attribute content because the tool tip cannot be fully
                  displayed within the viewport. </p></li><li><p> Some user agents allow access to supplementary information through the context
                  menu. For example, the keystroke combination Shift+F10 followed by P will display
                  the <code>title</code> attribute content, along with other supplementary
                  information in Mozilla/Firefox. </p></li><li><p>The HTML 4.01 specification explains that the text of the <code>alt</code>
                  attribute is to be displayed when the element cannot be rendered normally. Thus,
                  visual User Agents will display the <code>alt</code> attribute text when images
                  are not displayed. The <code>title</code> attribute is meant to provide additional
                  information. User Agents generally will display the <code>title</code> attribute
                  text when the mouse is placed over the element containing the <code>title</code>
                  attribute. Internet Explorer will display the <code>alt</code> text on mouse-over
                  if there is no <code>title</code> text. The Firefox and Opera browsers only
                  display the <code>title</code> text on mouse-over and do not use the
                  <code>alt</code> attribute text for this purpose. </p></li><li><p>Assistive technologies provide different levels of support for speaking title attributes. Some do not include features that allow users to access information provided via the title attribute.</p></li><li><p>JAWS 7.0 and above will speak the value of title attributes depending upon a JAWS setting. This setting can be changed temporarily or permanently within JAWS.</p></li><li><p>WindowEyes 5.5 and above has a hot key, ins-E, that will speak additional information, including the title attribute, for the item with focus. </p></li><li><p>Implementing this technique with the <code>title</code> attribute is only sufficient if the <code>title</code> attribute is accessibility supported. If the value of the <code>title</code> is essential to understanding the purpose of the link for all users, then the content of this attribute needs to be available to all keyboard users (not only those with text-to-speech software) for this technique to be accessibility supported.</p></li></ul></div></section><section id="H35"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H35.html">H35</a>:  Providing text alternatives on applet elements </h2><div class="ua-issue"><ul><li><p>This technique is not supported well by assistive technologies. The HTML specification explains that text alternatives for applets are to be displayed when the element cannot be rendered. Therefore, text alternatives that are included in the body of <code>applet</code> elements may not be available to users unless the user agent either does not support or has been configured not to render applets. </p></li><li><p>IE 6 for Windows and Firefox 1.5 and Opera 9 on Windows treat alternative text for the applet element differently. IE will display the body text of the applet element and not the <code>alt</code> attribute. Firefox and Opera will display the <code>alt</code> attribute but not the body text. </p></li></ul></div></section><section id="H44"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H44.html">H44</a>: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls</h2><div class="ua-issue"><p>The HTML and XHTML specifications allow both implicit and explicit labels. However, some
              assistive technologies do not correctly handle implicit labels (for example,
                <code>&lt;label&gt;First name &lt;input type="text"
                name="firstname"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</code>).</p><ul><li><p>JAWS 7.10 was tested on Windows XP with Internet Explorer 6.0 and Firefox 1.5. It
                  reads the label for explicit and implicit labels for text fields in both virtual
                  PC cursor and forms reading mode. In forms mode it does not read the label for
                  implicit labels on checkboxes and radio fields.</p></li><li><p>Window-Eyes 5.5 was tested on Windows XP with Internet Explorer 6.0 and Firefox
                  1.5. It will always speak the label for an explicitly labelled form field. It does
                  not speak the label for the implicitly labelled form control in browse on mode but
                  will speak the implicit label when navigating from control to control in browse
                  off mode. </p></li></ul></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>User agents will display a tool tip when the mouse hovers above an <code>input</code>
              element containing a <code>title</code> attribute. Title attributes are exposed to
              assistive technology and are displayed as tooltips in many graphical browsers.
              Tooltips can't be opened via the keyboard, so this information may not be available to
              sighted keyboard users. </p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>If no <code>label</code> is available, JAWS and Window-Eyes speak the
              <code>title</code> attribute when the form control receives focus </p><ul><li><p>JAWS 6.0 and later can be set to speak both <code>label</code> and
                  <code>title</code> when the two items are different; however, very few users are
                  aware of this setting.</p></li><li><p>WindowEyes 5.5 has a hot key, ins-E, that will display additional information,
                  including the title attribute, for the item with focus. </p></li></ul></div></section><section id="H45"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H45.html">H45</a>: Using longdesc</h2><div class="ua-issue"><p>User Agent support for <code>longdesc</code> varies, but overall support is improving. Screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, and Window-Eyes support <code>longdesc</code>, but Voiceover 4.0, Orca 2.32.0, and screen magnifier Zoomtext 10.0 do not yet support the <code>longdesc</code> attribute.

              The same is true for Japanese versions of these screen readers. Versions of JAWS prior
              to version 5 and older versions of Window-Eyes have inconsistent support for
                <code>scope</code>.</p><p>At the current time, those who want to ensure consistent support across Assistive
