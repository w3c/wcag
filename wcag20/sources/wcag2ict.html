		</section> <section id="intro"> <h2><span class="secno">1. </span>Introduction</h2> <p>This document provides informative guidance (guidance that is not normative, and that does not set requirements) with regard to the interpretation and application of <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> [<cite><a href="#REF-WCAG20">WCAG20</a></cite>] to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT). This document is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr#WGNote">Working Group Note</a> (in contrast to WCAG 2.0, which is a W3C Recommendation and also an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) / International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard). Specifically, this document provides informative guidance on applying WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria to non-web ICT, specifically to non-web documents and software.</p> <p>This document is intended to help clarify how to use WCAG 2.0 to make non-web
		documents and software more accessible to people with disabilities. Addressing accessibility involves addressing the needs of people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities, and the needs of people with accessibility requirements due to the effects of aging. Although this document covers a wide range of issues, it is not able to address all the needs of all people with disabilities. Because WCAG 2.0 was developed for the Web, addressing accessibility for non-web documents and software may involve provisions beyond those included in this document. Authors and developers are encouraged to seek relevant advice about current best practices to ensure that non-web documents and software are accessible, as far as possible, to people with disabilities.</p> <p>While WCAG 2.0 was designed to be technology-neutral, it assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content.
		Therefore, the application of WCAG 2.0 to documents and software in non-web contexts required some interpretation in order to determine how the intent of each WCAG 2.0 success criterion could be met in these different contexts of use. The bulk of the Task Force's work therefore involved evaluating how each WCAG 2.0 success criterion would apply in the context of non-web ICT, if it were applied to non-web ICT.</p> <p>The Task Force found that the majority of success criteria from WCAG 2.0 can apply to non-web documents and software with no or only minimal changes. Specifically, of the thirty-eight Level A and AA success criteria, twenty-six did not include any web related terms and apply directly as written and as described in the “Intent” sections from the updated <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding WCAG 2.0</a> [<cite><a href="#REF-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20">UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20</a></cite>]. Thirteen of these twenty-six applied without any additional
		notes. The other thirteen applied as written but additional notes were also provided for assistance in applying them to either or both non-web documents and software. </p> <p>Of the remaining twelve success criteria, the Task Force found that eight of them apply as written when replacing certain Web-specific terms or phrases like “web page(s)” with non-web terms or phrases like “non-web document(s) and software” or “for non-web documents and software that use markup languages, in such a way that…” etc. Additional notes were also provided to assist in the application of these. </p> <p>The remaining four success criteria apply in situations when “a set of web pages”, or “multiple web pages” share some characteristic or behavior. In WCAG 2.0 the “unit of conformance” is the web page. While WCAG2ICT is not a standard, and thus conformance does not apply, it is still useful to look at what a “unit of evaluation” would be for non-web ICT. For non-web documents, WCAG2ICT uses a single
		document as the “unit of evaluation”, as it is the best analog to a web page. This became the basis for the notion of a “<a href="#keyterms_set-of-documents">set of documents</a>”, which is used for the remaining four success criteria which in WCAG speak to “sets of web pages”. For non-web software it wasn't possible to unambiguously carve up software into discrete pieces, and so the “unit of evaluation” for non-web software is the software program. This became the basis for the notion of a “<a href="#keyterms_set-of-software">set of software programs</a>”, which is used for the remaining four success criteria.</p> <p>The 83 glossary terms were also reviewed. 51 applied to non-Web documents and software as written. Another 28 applied with additional notes or edits (largely related to phrases like “Web page(s)”), and the remaining 4 terms were only used in Level AAA success criteria which are not addressed by this Note.</p> <section id="intro_excluded">
		<h3>Excluded from Scope</h3>
		<p>The following are out of scope for this document:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This document does not seek to determine which WCAG 2.0 provisions (principles, guidelines, or success criteria) should or should not apply to non-web ICT, but rather how they would apply, if applied.</li>
			<li>This document does not propose changes to WCAG 2.0 itself, nor its supporting documents; and does not include interpretations for implementing WCAG 2.0 in web technologies. During the development of this document, the WCAG2ICT Task Force did seek clarification on the intent of a number of the success criteria, which led to clarifications that are being made to the Understanding WCAG 2.0 document. </li>
			<li>Because this document deals with applying WCAG, which is a standard for web content accessibility, to ICT it does not deal with such things as closed products and requirements for non-user interface aspects of platforms, nor individual components. As such, this document is not sufficient by itself to ensure accessibility in non-web documents and software.</li>
			<li>This document does not comment on hardware aspects of products, non-user interface aspects of platforms, or user-interface components as individual items, because the basic constructs on which WCAG 2.0 is built do not apply to these. </li>
			<li>This document does not provide supporting techniques for implementing WCAG 2.0 in non-web documents and software.</li>
			<li>As this document is purely an informative Note about non-web ICT, and not a standard, it doesn't describe how non-web ICT should conform to it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Document Overview</h3>
		<p>This document includes excerpted text from WCAG 2.0 principles, guidelines, and success criteria, as quoted from WCAG 2.0 without any changes. It also includes excerpted text from the “Intent” sections of the WCAG 2.0 supporting document <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding WCAG 2.0 (Public Review Draft)</a> [<cite><a href="#REF-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20">UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20</a></cite>], as clarified based on input from Task Force discussions and responses to public comments after review and approval by the WCAG Working Group. The guidance provided by this document for each success criteria is preceded by a title beginning “Additional Guidance…”. This guidance was created by the WCAG2ICT Task Force, then reviewed and approved by the WCAG Working Group. </p>
		<p>Additional supporting documents for WCAG 2.0, such as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">WCAG 2.0 Overview</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2.0</a> [<cite><a href="#REF-WCAG20-TECHS">WCAG20-TECHS</a></cite>], and <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">How to Meet WCAG 2.0: A customizable quick reference</a>, remain available for web content, but have not been changed to apply to non-web documents and software.</p>

		<h2>Document Conventions</h2>
		<p>The following stylistic conventions are used in this document:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Quotes from WCAG 2.0 and Understanding WCAG 2.0 are in &lt;blockquote> elements and visually styled as pale yellow inset boxes in slightly smaller text. They are prefaced by a reference to the original source such as “From {reference title} in {document}”.</li>
			<li>Additional guidance provided by this document begins with the phrase “Additional guidance” and is visually styled in pale blue boxes labeled by a heading having a dark blue background.</li>
			<li>Quotes from WCAG 2.0 begin with “From” and the success criterion number and name, and are presented as modified by the advice in this document with the modifications in &lt;ins> elements visually styled as bold red text with dotted underlines.</li>
			<li>Notes are slightly inset and begin with the phrase “Note:”. If there are multiple notes for a specific item, they are numbered, e.g., “Note 1:”, etc.</li>
			<li>References to glossary items from WCAG 2.0 are presented in &lt;cite> elements visually styled as ordinary text with a dotted underline, and contain title attributes noting these are WCAG definitions. They turn blue with a yellow background when mouse or keyboard focus is placed over them.</li>
			<li>References to glossary items in this document are presented in &lt;cite> elements visually styled as ordinary text with a dashed underline, and contain title attributes noting these are Task Force definitions. They turn green with a yellow background when mouse or keyboard focus is placed over them. Note that some terms defined in WCAG 2.0 are redefined in WCAG2ICT and links are updated accordingly (except in direct quotes).</li>
			<li>Hereafter, the short title “WCAG2ICT” is used to reference this document. </li>
		</ul>
		</section> </section><section id="keyterms"> <h2><span class="secno">2. </span>Key Terms</h2> <p>Of the 83 glossary terms used in WCAG 2.0 there are two key glossary terms that need to be interpreted significantly differently when applied to non-web ICT. These are: “content” and “user agent”. Further, the glossary term “Web page” in WCAG 2.0 is replaced with newly defined terms “document” and “software”, and both “set of web pages” and “multiple web pages” are replaced with the newly defined terms “set of documents” and “set of software programs”. Finally, as part of addressing the fact that non-Web software doesn't leverage the WCAG 2.0 notion of a user agent, we introduce the new term “accessibility services of platform software”. The remaining 79 glossary terms from WCAG 2.0 are addressed in <a href="#wcag2ict_comments_definitions">Chapter 7 Comments on Definitions in WCAG 2.0 Glossary in Appendix A</a>. Terms defined and used in WCAG2ICT are applicable only to the interpretation of the guidance in this
		document. The particular definitions should not be interpreted as having applicability to situations beyond the scope of WCAG2ICT. Further information on usage of these terms follows.</p> <section id="keyterms_accessibility-services">

					<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note 3: </strong>Consistent does not mean identical. For example, if a list of choices is provided it might not include the name of the current program.</p>

					<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note 6:</strong> If there is any ambiguity whether the group is a set, then the group is not a set</p>
					<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note 7</strong>: If there is no independent method to launch the software programs (as is common in closed products), those programs would not meet the definition of a set of programs. </p>
					<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note 8: </strong>Although the term “software” is used throughout this document because this would apply to stand alone software programs as well as individual software components and the software components in software-hardware combinations, the concept of “set of software programs” would only apply (by definition) to programs that can be launched separately from each other. Therefore, for the provisions that use the phrase “set of” (success criteria 2.4.1, 2.4.5, 3.2.3, and 3.2.4), the phrase “set of software programs” is used.</p>

		<p><strong>Counterexamples: </strong>Examples of things that are <strong>not</strong> sets of software programs:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A suite of programs for authoring different types of documents (text, spreadsheets, presentations, etc.) where the programs don't provide an explicit, consistent means to launch, or switch to, each of the other programs in the group. </li>
			<li>An office package consisting of multiple programs that launches as a single program that provides multiple functionalities such as writing, spreadsheet, etc., but the only way to navigate between programs is to open a document in one of the programs.</li>
			<li>A bundle of software programs that is sold together but the only way to navigate between the programs in the bundle is to use a platform software level menu to navigate between them (and not via a menu provided by each program that allows you to navigate to just the other programs in this bundle).</li>
			<li>A group of programs that was a set, but the programs have been moved to separate locations so that their “set” behaviors were disrupted and no longer work.

		<h2><span class="secno">3. </span>Closed Functionality</h2>
		<p>As noted in the Introduction, WCAG 2.0 assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content. Furthermore, many of the success criteria in WCAG 2.0 assume web content will be accessed by ICT that has assistive technologies connected to it, where the assistive technologies present the web content to the people with disabilities in accessible form. ICT products with “closed functionality” do not allow the use of some assistive technologies for all of their functions. In many cases such ICT products also lack a “user agent” or their equivalent. As a result, ICT following these success criteria by themselves will not make information accessible on ICT with closed functionality. Something else needs to be provided or be required in order to make the information addressed in these success criteria accessible. It is outside the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG2ICT-WorkStatement">task force work
			statement</a> to say what the additional measures are, but this Note points out which success criteria depend on assistive technologies—and therefore would not work by themselves in products with closed functionality. </p>
		<p>Because closed functionality, by definition, does not allow a user to attach assistive technology, WCAG success criteria that assume the presence of assistive technology will not facilitate accessibility as WCAG 2.0 intends. Where assistive technologies cannot be used, other output and input solutions are needed to achieve the intent of these success criteria.</p>
		<p>Examples of products with closed functionality include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>an ebook or ebook reader program that allows assistive technologies to access all of the user interface controls of the ebook program (open functionality) but does not allow the assistive technologies to access the actual content of book (closed functionality).</li>
			<li>an operating system that requires the user to provide log in credentials before it allows any assistive technologies to be loaded. The log-in portion would be closed functionality. </li>
			<li>a travel kiosk that provides an audio interface for blind and vision-impaired users as a built-in alternative to the visual interface and tactile keys as an alternative to touch screen operation for both blind users and those who can't operate a touch screen.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>See <a href="#closed_functionality_sc">Appendix A: Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality</a> for a list of success criteria for which this is relevant.</p>
		</section> <section id="command_line_interfaces">
		<h2><span class="secno">4. </span>Text / Command-line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces</h2>
		<p>Text applications are a class of software ICT that appeared decades ago, prior to the emergence of the graphical user interface (GUI) and the Web. The interface of a text application is generated using only text characters, and either a hardware terminal or a software terminal application handles the rendering of the text application—similar to how a web user agent handles the rendering of a web application. Text applications only accept text input (though some terminal applications which render text applications in the GUI may utilize a mouse or other input devices). Command-line applications are a subset of text applications with further specific properties.</p>
		<p>Historically, assistive technologies developed alongside text applications, and several of these use a variety of analysis and scripting techniques to make text applications accessible. Although there are far fewer new text applications being developed compared to new GUI or web applications, text applications remain in use today, and both text applications and the assistive technologies designed for text applications are in active development.</p>
		<p>Though this class of applications predates the Web, WCAG can be applied to them. As noted in <a href="#command_line_interfaces_background">Appendix B. Background on Text / Command-line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces</a>, applying WCAG to text / command-line applications involves understanding how text applications are rendered, how text applications have been made accessible via assistive technologies, and how to apply the concepts of “accessibility supported” and “programmatically determined” to text applications.</p>

		<h2><span class="secno">6. </span>Comments on Conformance </h2>
		<p>WCAG2ICT is not a standard, so it is not possible to conform to WCAG2ICT. However, some entities may wish to use the information in WCAG2ICT to help establish standards or regulations regarding accessibility in ICT that are based on WCAG 2.0. While such standards or regulations will need to address matters of conformance themselves, the following notes may be of assistance to those wishing to draft their own requirements:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The WCAG 2.0 success criteria and the conformance requirements were designed to work together, such that the language of the success criteria is based on the nature of the conformance requirements. The choice of what level to use for a given criteria (A vs. AA vs. AAA) was further influenced by a number of factors specific to the web domain, as set forth in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head">Understanding Levels of Compliance</a>.</li>
			<li>In the WCAG 2.0 conformance model, a success criterion is satisfied if the item being evaluated does not fail it. If the success criterion is in relation to something that does not exist for the item being evaluated (e.g. a success criterion is about captioning audio and there is no audio) then the success criterion is automatically met. This approach is central to the way the success criteria in WCAG are structured and worded.</li>
			<li>WCAG 2.0 conformance is applied to the item being evaluated (i.e. web page) as a whole, except when a process includes use of several items, in which case all of the items that are needed in order to complete the process must conform.</li>
			<li>In WCAG 2.0, when conformance relies on accessibility features of the platform (i.e. browser for web content) or on assistive technologies, WCAG 2.0 requires that there are assistive technologies, etc. that work with the product (web page). That is, conformance with WCAG 2.0 requires that the approaches used are supported by assistive technologies.</li>
			<li>WCAG 2.0 allows information on part of a page to not conform if the same information is available elsewhere on the page in conforming fashion. However WCAG 2.0 identifies 4 success criteria that must be met on all areas of the page because they can interfere with the user's ability to access and use other parts of the page:<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-dis-audio">1.4.2 Audio Control</a>;</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#keyboard-operation-trapping">2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap</a>;</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#time-limits-pause">2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</a>.</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#seizure-does-not-violate">2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold</a>;</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Also, as noted in the Introduction, it wasn't possible to unambiguously carve up software into discrete pieces, and so the unit of evaluation for non-web software is the whole software program. As with any software testing this can be a very large unit of evaluation, and methods similar to standard software testing might be used.</p>

		<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note 2:</strong> The definitions of “<a href="#keyterms_set-of-documents">set of documents</a>” and “<a href="#keyterms_set-of-software">set of software programs</a>” in the Key Terms section if the Introduction are predicated on the ability to navigate from each element of the set to each other, and navigation is a type of locating. So the mechanism used to navigate between elements of the set will be one way of locating information in the set. Non-web environments, generally major operating systems with browse and search capabilities, often provide infrastructure and tools that provide mechanisms for locating content in a set of non-web documents or a set of software programs. For example, it may be possible to browse through the files or programs that make up a set, or search within members of the set for the names of other members. A file directory would be the equivalent of a site map for documents in a set, and a search function in a
			file system would be equivalent to a web search function for web pages. Such facilities may provide additional ways of locating information in the set.</p>
		<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note 3: </strong>An example of the use of “a software program that is part of process”, that would meet the exception for this Success Criterion, would be one where programs are interlinked but the interlinking depends on program A being used before program B, for validation or to initialize the dataset etc. </p>
		<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note 4: </strong>While some users may find it useful to have multiple ways to locate some groups of user interface elements within a document or software program, this is not required by the success criterion (and may pose difficulties in some situations).</p>

The purpose of the exception—that items in a process are exempt from meeting this success criterion—is achieved by the definition of set.</p>

					<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note 1: </strong> functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible). </p>

Many <ins>mainstream ICTs</ins> provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that <ins>mainstream ICTs</ins> target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The <ins>mainstream ICT</ins> may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving <ins><a href="#wcag2ict-def_content" class="wcag2ict_termref">content</a></ins> from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles. </p>

						<li>
							<p>screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;</p>

		</section> <section class="appendix" id="command_line_interfaces_background"> <h2><span class="secno">Appendix B. </span>Background on Text / Command-line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces</h2> <section class="appendix" id="command_line_interfaces_background_text">
		<h3>How text interfaces are realized</h3>
		<p>The interface of a text application is realized through a text application directing which characters should be placed on the screen, along with either a hardware terminal or a terminal application that displays the characters produced by the text application. Some text applications render like a TeleTYpewriter (“TTY”); their output is always appended, like an ever growing file. Such text applications are often called “command-line applications” or occasionally “TTY-applications”, and their output can optionally be redirected to a file for later review. Others explicitly place text into a matrix of fixed width character cells on a screen (sometimes with specific foreground and background colors). Similar to a web application, the text application may execute primarily on a remote server or execute locally, and a local client terminal application handles the visual display (similar to a web user agent). Input to the text application itself is provided exclusively through a
			keyboard interface.</p>
		</section> <section class="appendix" id="command_line_interfaces_background_at">
		<h3>How text applications have been made accessible via assistive technology</h3>
		<p>Strategies for making text applications accessible through assistive technology involve two key tasks: (1) obtaining all of the text displayed in the interface, and (2) performing an analysis on that text to discern structural elements and screen updates.</p>
		<p>For example, a text application screen reader might directly access the matrix of character cells in the interface and provide a screen review mechanism for the user to review that matrix of characters (by sending the output to synthetic speech and / or a braille display). Alternately, a text application screen reader might directly consume the output rendered (perhaps by acting as its own terminal application or by analyzing the “TTY” output). The text application screen reader would also analyze the spacing and layout of the text in the matrix to provide features such as reading columns of text in a multi-column layout, discerning headers through analysis of line spacing, indentation and capitalization, and discerning input fields or user interface components, etc. by scanning for the use of inverse video or for text appearing in brackets or text from the character graphics codepage (ASCII codes greater than ‘0x7F’). Some of this analysis might also be done through the use of
			filter tools that transform the output of a program (e.g. through reformatting “TTY” output rendered to a file or as direct input to a filter too).</p>
		<p>Similarly, a text application screen magnifier would gain access to the matrix of character cells in order to magnify them or re-display them in a larger font. It would scan for screen refreshes / updates and apply heuristics to what had changed in order to decide what sub-matrix of character cells should appear in a magnified view. It would also scan for inverse video and a moving text cursor to track text being input by the user (and might combine the text matrix scanning with scanning of the keyboard input to match user input to what is appearing on the screen).</p>
		</section> <section class="appendix" id="command_line_interfaces_background_applying">
		<h3>Applying WCAG 2.0 to text applications</h3>
		<p>To apply WCAG to text applications, it is necessary to apply the glossary terms “accessibility supported” and “programmatically determined” in the context of how text applications are rendered and the history of assistive technologies that made them accessible.</p>
		<p>As noted above, in a text interface the terminal application renders the characters on the screen, just as a web browser typically renders content for a web application. Thus for example, in success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-scale">1.4.4 Resize Text</a>, a text application could achieve 200 percent resizing when the terminal application client that is rendering it has this capability (cf. WCAG 2.0 Technique <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20-TECHS/G142">G142 Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support zoom</a>). Many web pages and web applications use this approach to meet success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-scale">1.4.4 Resize Text</a> through no explicit action of their own.</p>
		<p>A similar approach could also be used for success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast">1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)</a> (cf. WCAG 2.0 Technique <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20-TECHS/G148">G148: Not specifying background color, not specifying text color, and not using technology features that change those defaults</a>): relying on the terminal application client to render the text with sufficient contrast against the background. In fact, many terminal applications allow the user to force all text to share a single user-chosen foreground color (and a single user-chosen background color), overriding the text application's specified colors in order to meet the user's desires or needs.</p>
		<p>Since many assistive technology analysis techniques depend upon discerning the location of the text input cursor, terminal application use of “soft cursors” and “highlight bars” may bypass those analysis techniques and cause failures of success criteria.</p>
		<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note: </strong>It is outside of the scope of this document to define WCAG techniques for non-web ICT. These examples are simply raised here to illustrate how WCAG 2.0 success criteria can be applied to this older class of applications that pre-date the Web.</p>
		<p>The way to think about “<a href="#accessibility-supporteddef">accessibility supported</a>” and “<a href="#programmaticallydetermineddef">programmatically determined</a>” may seem a little different for text applications, but the definitions are unchanged. Because assistive technologies developed analysis techniques to recognize many forms of tabular layout, column headers, and section headings, such recognized layouts are by definition “accessibility supported”. Where assistive technology is able to extract and present that information, it is “programmatically determinable”—even though no explicit markup or API was used to make it so. While such assistive technology analysis techniques are not used for supporting newer technologies, the fact that such previous analysis work was done allows us to apply WCAG 2.0 to text / command-line applications.</p>
		<p class="note"><strong class="note-title">Note: </strong>The terminal application itself is “traditional” non-web software ICT. It is only for the text application that there is a need to take this approach with these glossary terms.</p>
