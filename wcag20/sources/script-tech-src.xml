					<p>The objective of this technique is to allow user to extend the default time limit by providing a mechanism to extend the time when scripts provide functionality that has default time limits. In order to allow the user to request a longer time limit, the script can provide a form (for example) allowing the user to enter a larger time limit or indicating that more time is needed. If the user is being warned that a time limit is about to expire (see <specref
						ref="SCR16"
						/>), this form can be made available from the warning dialog. The user can extend the time limit to at least 10 times the default time limit, either by allowing the user to indicate how much additional time is needed or by repeatedly allowing the user to extend the time limit.</p>
				</description>

A Web page contains current stock market statistics and is set to refresh periodically. When the user is warned prior to refreshing the first time, the user is provided with an option to extend the time period between refreshes.

					<p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate using device independent events to change a decorative image in response to a mouse or focus event. Use the <code><![CDATA[onmouseover]]></code> and onmouseout events to change a decorative image when the mouse moves on top of or away from an element on the page. Also, use the <code><![CDATA[onfocus]]></code> and <code><![CDATA[onblur]]></code> events to change the image when the element receives and loses focus.</p>
					<p>The example below has a decorative image in front of an anchor element. When the user mouses over the anchor tag, the decorative image in front of the anchor is changed. When the mouse moves off of the anchor, the image is changed back to its original version. The same image change effect occurs when the user gives keyboard focus to the anchor element. When focus is received the image changes, when focus is lost the image is changed back. This is accomplished by attaching <code><![CDATA[onmouseover]]></code>, <code><![CDATA[onmouseout]]></code>, <code><![CDATA[onfocus]]></code> and <code><![CDATA[onblur]]></code> event handlers to the anchor element. The event handler is a JavaScript function called updateImage(), which changes the src attribute of the image. The updateImage() is called in response to the onmouseover, onmouseout, onfocus, and onblur events.</p>
					<p>Each image is given a unique id. This unique id is passed to updateImage() along with a boolean value indicating which image is to be used: <code><![CDATA[updateImage(imgId, isOver);]]></code>. The boolean value of true is passed when the mouse is over the anchor element or it has focus. A false value is passed when the mouse moves off of the anchor element or it loses focus. The updateImage() function uses the image id to load the image and then changes the src attribue based on the boolean value. Note that since the image is for decorative purposes, it has a null alt attribute. </p>
					<note>
						<p>It is best to use images that are similar in size and to specify the height and width attributes on the image element. This will prevent any changes to the layout of the page when the image is updated. This example uses images which are identical in size. </p>

				<short-name>Using scripts to make nonessential alerts optional</short-name>
				<applicability>
					<p>Scripting technologies which use scripting alerts for non-emergency communication.</p>
				</applicability>
				<applies-to>
					<success-criterion idref="time-limits-postponed"
						relationship="sufficient"/>
				</applies-to>
				<description>
					<p>The objective of this technique is to display a dialog containing a message (alert) to the user.  When the alert is displayed, it receives focus and the user must activate the OK button on the dialog to dismiss it. Since these alerts cause focus to change they may distract the user, especially when used for non-emergency information. Alerts for non-emergency purposes such as displaying a quote of the day, helpful usage tip, or count down to a particular event, are not presented unless the user enables them through an option provided in the Web page.</p>
					<p>This technique assigns a global JavaScript variable to store the user preference for displaying alerts. The default value is false. A wrapper function is created to check the value of this variable before displaying an alert. All calls to display an alert are made to this wrapper function rather than calling the alert() function directly. Early in the page, a button is provided for the user to enable the display of alerts on the page. This technique works on a visit by visit basis.     Each time the page is loaded, alerts will be disabled and the user must manually enable them. Alternatively, the author could use cookies to store user preferences across sessions.</p>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<eg-group>
						<description>
							<p>The script below will display a quote in an alert box every ten seconds, if the user selects the "Turn Alerts On" button. The user can turn the quotes off again by choosing "Turn Alerts Off".</p>
						</description>
						<code><![CDATA[
<script type="text/javascript">
var bDoAlerts = false;  // global variable which specifies whether to 
                                       // display alerts or not
/* function to enable/disable alerts.
 * param boolean bOn - true to enable alerts, false to disable them.
*/
function modifyAlerts(isEnabled) {
   bDoAlerts = isEnabled;
}
/* wrapper function for displaying alerts.  Checks the value of bDoAlerts
*and only calls the alert() function when bDoAlerts is true.
*/
function doAlert(aMessage) {
    if (bDoAlerts) {
       alert(aMessage);
    }
}
// example usage - a loop to display famous quotes.
var gCounter = -1;  // global to store counter
// quotes variable would be initialized with famous quotations
var quotes = new Array("quote 1", "quote 2", "quote 3", "quote 4", "quote 5");
function showQuotes() {
   if (++gCounter &gt;= quotes.length) {
     gCounter = 0;
   }
   doAlert(quotes[gCounter]);
   setTimeout("showQuotes();", 10000);
}
showQuotes();

				<short-name>Providing a script that warns the user a time limit is about to expire</short-name>

Time limits exist that are controlled by script.

				<description>
					<p>
The objective of this technique is to notify users that they are almost out of time to complete an interaction. When scripts provide functionality that has time limits, the script can include functionality to warn the user of imminent time limits and provide a mechanism to request more time. 20 seconds or more before the time limit occurs, the script provides a confirm dialog that states that a time limit is imminent and asks if the user needs more time. If the user answers "yes" then the time limit is reset. If the user answers "no" or does not respond, the time limit is allowed to expire.
</p>
					<p>
This technique involves time limits set with the <code><![CDATA[window.setTimeout()]]></code> method. If, for example, the time limit is set to expire in 60 seconds, you can set the time limit for 40 seconds and provide the confirm dialog. When the confirm dialog appears, a new time limit is set for the remaining 20 seconds. Upon expiry of the "grace period time limit" the action that would have been taken at the expiry of the 60 second time limit in the original design is taken.
</p>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<eg-group>
						<description>
							<p>
A page of stock market quotes uses script to refresh the page every five minutes in order to ensure the latest statistics remain available. 20 seconds before the five minute period expires, a confirm dialog appears asking if the user needs more time before the page refreshes. This allows the user to be aware of the impending refresh and to avoid it if desired.

					<p> The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to correctly use an
                        onchange event with a select element to update other elements on the Web page. This technique will not cause a change of context. When there are one
                        or more select elements on the Web page, an onchange event on one, can
                        update the options in another select element on the Web page. All of the
                        data required by the select elements is included within the Web page. </p>
					<p> It is important to note that the select item which is modified is after the
                        trigger select element in the reading order of the Web page. This ensures
                        that assistive technologies will pick up the change and users will encounter
                        the new data when the modified element receives focus. This technique relies
                        on JavaScript support in the user agent. </p>

							<p> This example contains two select elements. When an item is selected

                                countries located in the selected continent. There is an onchange
                                event associated with the continent select. When the continent
                                selection changes, the items in the country select are modified
                                using JavaScript via the Document Object Model (DOM). All of the

                        The objective of this technique is to illustrate the use of both keyboard-specific and mouse-specific events with code that has a scripting function associated with an event. Using both keyboard-specific and mouse-specific events together ensures that content can be operated by a wide range of devices. For example, a script may perform the same action when a keypress is detected that is performed when a mouse button is clicked. This technique goes beyond the Success Criterion requirement for keyboard access by including not only keyboard access but access using other devices as well. 
                    </p>
					<p>
            In JavaScript, commonly used event handlers include, onblur, onchange, onclick, ondblclick, onfocus, onkeydown, onkeypress, onkeyup, onload, onmousedown, onmousemove, onmouseout, onmouseover, onmouseup, onreset, onselect, onsubmit, onunload. Some mouse-specific functions have a logical corresponding keyboard-specific function (such as 'onmouseover' and 'onfocus'). A keyboard event handler should be provided that executes the same function as the mouse event handler.
                    </p>
					<p>
                        The following table suggests keyboard event handlers to pair mouse event handlers.

						<sup>1</sup> Although <code>click</code> is in principle a mouse event handler, most HTML and XHTML user agents also process this event when a native HTML control (e.g. a button or a link) is activated, regardless of whether it was activated with the mouse or the keyboard. In practice, therefore, it is not necessary to duplicate this event when adding handlers to natively focusable HTML elements. However, it is necessary when adding handlers to other events, such as in Example 2 below.</p>
					<p>
						<sup>2</sup> Since the <code>keypress</code> event handler reacts to any key, the event handler function should check first to ensure the Enter key was pressed before proceeding to handle the event. Otherwise, the event handler will run each time the user presses any key, even the tab key to leave the control, and this is usually not desirable.
                    </p>
					<p>
                    Some mouse-specific functions (such as <code><![CDATA[dblclick]]></code> and <code><![CDATA[mousemove]]></code>) do  not have a corresponding keyboard-specific function. This means that some functions may need  to be implemented differently for each device (for example, including a series of buttons to execute, via keyboard, the equivalent mouse-specific functions implemented).</p>

								This example shows a custom image control for which both the mouse and the keyboard can be used to activate the function. The mouse event <code><![CDATA[onclick]]></code> is duplicated by an appropriate keyboard event <code><![CDATA[onkeypress]]></code>. The <code><![CDATA[tabindex]]></code> attribute ensures that the keyboard will have a tab stop on the image. Note that in this example, the <code><![CDATA[nextPage()]]></code> function should check that the keyboard key pressed was Enter, otherwise it will respond to all keyboard actions while the image has focus, which is not the desired behavior.</p>
						</description>
						<code><![CDATA[
<img onclick="nextPage();" onkeypress="nextPage();" tabindex="0" src="arrow.gif" 
alt="Go to next page"> ]]></code>
						<description>
							<note>
								<p>This example uses tabindex on an <code><![CDATA[img]]></code> element. Even though this is currently invalid, it is provided as a transitional technique to make this function work. Custom controls like this should also use WAI-ARIA to expose the role and state of the control.</p>

						<p>This example was successfully tested on Windows XP with IE 6 and Firefox 1.5.0.1 using both JAWS 7 and WindowEyes 5.5. Note that when adding new content onto a page, the screen readers may not automatically speak the new content.  In order to ensure that new content is spoken, set focus to the new element or make certain that it is added below the current location and will be encountered as the user continues to traverse the page.
</p>
					</ua-issue>
				</ua-issues>
				<description>
					<p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to use functions of the Document Object Model (DOM) to add content to a page instead of using <code><![CDATA[document.write]]></code> or <code><![CDATA[object.innerHTML]]></code>. The <code><![CDATA[document.write()]]></code> method does not work with XHTML when served with the correct MIME type (application/xhtml+xml), and the <code><![CDATA[innerHTML]]></code> property is not part of the DOM specification and thus should be avoided.  If the DOM functions are used to add the content, user agents can access the DOM to retrieve the content. The <code><![CDATA[createElement()]]></code> function can be used to create elements within the DOM.  The <code><![CDATA[createTextNode()]]></code> is used to create text associated with elements.  The <code><![CDATA[appendChild()]]></code>, <code><![CDATA[removeChild()]]></code>, <code><![CDATA[insertBefore()]]></code> and <code><![CDATA[replaceChild()]]></code> functions are used to add and remove elements and nodes. Other DOM functions are used to assign attributes to the created elements.</p>
					<note>
						<p>When adding focusable elements into the document, do not add <code><![CDATA[tabindex]]></code> attributes to explicitly set the tab order as this can cause problems when adding focusable elements into the middle of a document. Let the default tab order be assigned to the new element by not explicitly setting a <code><![CDATA[tabindex]]></code> attribute.</p>

							<p>This example demonstrates use of client-side scripting to validate a form. If errors are found appropriate error messages are displayed.  The example uses the DOM functions to add error notification consisting of a title, a short paragraph explaining that an error has occurred, and a list of errors in an ordered list. The content of the title is written as a link so that it can be used to draw the user's attention to the error using the focus method. Each item in the list is also written as a link that places the focus onto the form field in error when the link is followed.</p>
							<p>For simplicity, the example just validates two text fields, but can easily be extended to become a generic form handler. Client-side validation should not be the sole means of validation , and should be backed up with server-side validation. The benefit of client-side validation is that you can provide immediate feedback to the user to save them waiting for the errors to come back from the server, and it helps reduce unnecessary traffic to the server.</p>
							<p>Here is the script that adds the event handlers to the form. If scripting is enabled, the validateNumbers() function will be called to perform client-side validation before the form is submitted to the server. If scripting is not enabled, the form will be immediately submitted to the server, so validation should also be implemented on the server. 
              </p>

                        opening new windows can disorient or be missed completely by some users.
                        If the document type does not allow the <code><![CDATA[target]]></code> attribute (it
                        does not exist in HTML 4.01 Strict or XHTML 1.0 Strict) or if the developer
                        prefers not to use it, new windows can be opened with ECMAScript. The

                        event handler to a link (<code><![CDATA[a]]></code> element) and warns the user that the

					<p>The objective of this technique is to place inserted user interface elements into the Document Object Model (DOM) in such a way that the tab order and screen-reader reading order are set correctly by the default behavior of the user agent. This technique can be used for any user interface element that is hidden and shown, such as menus and dialogs.</p>
					<p>The reading order in a screen-reader is based on the order of the HTML or XHTML elements in the Document Object Model, as is the default tab order. This technique inserts new content into the DOM immediately following the element that was activated to trigger the script. The triggering element must be a link or a button, and the script must be called from its onclick event. These elements are natively focusable, and their onclick event is device independent. Focus remains on the activated element and the new content, inserted after it, becomes the next thing in both the tab order and screen-reader reading order.</p>
					<p>Note that this technique works for synchronous updates. For asynchronous updates (sometimes called AJAX), an additional technique is needed to inform the assistive technology that the asynchronous content has been inserted. </p>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<eg-group>
						<description>
							<p>This example creates a menu when a link is clicked and inserts it after the link. The onclick event of the link is used to call the ShowHide script, passing in an ID for the new menu as a parameter.</p>
						</description>
						<code role="xhtml"><![CDATA[<a href="#" onclick="ShowHide('foo',this)">Toggle</a>]]></code>
						<description>
							<p>The ShowHide script creates a div containing the new menu, and inserts a link into it. The last line is the core of the script. It finds the parent of the element that triggered the script, and appends the div it created as a new child to it. This causes the new div to be in the DOM after the link. When the user hits tab, the focus will go to the first focusable item in the menu, the link we created.</p>
						</description>
						<code role="script"><![CDATA[function ShowHide(id,src)
{
	var el = document.getElementById(id);
	if (!el)
	{
		el = document.createElement("div");

					<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for re-ordering component which is both highly usable and accessible. The two most common mechanisms for reordering are to send users to a set-up page where they can number components, or to allow them to drag and drop components to the desired location. The drag and drop method is much more usable, as it allows the user to arrange the items in place, one at a time, and get a feeling for the results. Unfortunately, drag and drop relies on the use of a mouse. This technique allows users to interact with a menu on the components to reorder them in place in a device independent way. It can be used in place of, or in conjunction with drag and drop reordering functionality.</p>
					<p>The menu is a list of links using the device-independent onclick event to trigger scripts which re-order the content. The content is re-ordered in the Document Object Model (DOM), not just visually, so that it is in the correct order for all devices. </p>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<eg-group>
						<description>
							<p>This example does up and down reordering. This approach can also be used for two-dimensional reordering by adding left and right options.</p>
							<p>The components in this example are list items in an unordered list. Unordered lists are a very good semantic model for sets of similar items, like these components. The menu approach can also be used for other types of groupings.</p>
							<p>The modules are list items, and each module, in addition to content in div elements, contains a menu represented as a nested list. </p>

						<description>
							<p>Since we've covered the showing and hiding of menus in the simple tree samples, we'll focus here just on the code that swaps the modules. Once we harmonize the events and cancel the default link action, we go to work. First, we set a bunch of local variables for the elements with which we'll be working: the menu, the module to be reordered, the menuLink. Then, after checking the reorder direction, we try to grab the node to swap. If we find one, we then call swapNode() to swap our two modules, and PositionElement() to move the absolutely-positioned menu along with the module, and then set focus back on the menu item which launched the whole thing.</p>

						<code role="script"><![CDATA[function MoveNode(evt,dir)
{
    HarmonizeEvent(evt);
    evt.preventDefault();

				<description>
					<p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to provide keyboard access to a user interface control that is implemented by actions to static HTML elements such as <code><![CDATA[div]]></code> or <code><![CDATA[span]]></code>. This technique ensures that the element is focusable by setting the <code><![CDATA[tabindex]]></code> attribute, and it ensures that the action can be triggered from the keyboard by providing an <code><![CDATA[onkeyup]]></code> or <code><![CDATA[onkeypress]]></code> handler in addition to an <code><![CDATA[onclick]]></code> handler. </p>
					<p>When the <code><![CDATA[tabindex]]></code> attribute has the value 0, the element can be focused via the keyboard and is included in the tab order of the document. When the <code><![CDATA[tabindex]]></code> attribute has the value -1, the element cannot be tabbed to, but focus can be set programmatically, using <code><![CDATA[element.focus()]]></code>.</p>
					<p>Because static HTML elements do not have actions associated with them, it is not possible to provide a backup implementation or explanation in environments in which scripting is not available. This technique should only be used in environments in which client-side scripting can be relied upon.</p>
					<note>
						<p> Such user interface controls must still satisfy Success Criterion 4.1.2. Applying this technique without also providing role, name, and state information about the user interface control will results in Failure F59, Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to using script to make div or span a user interface control in HTML.</p>

						<head> Adding a JavaScript action to a div element</head>
						<description>
							<p>The <code><![CDATA[div]]></code> element on the page is given a unique <code><![CDATA[id]]></code> attribute and a <code><![CDATA[tabindex]]></code> attribute with value 0.  A script uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to find the <code><![CDATA[div]]></code> element by its id and add the <code><![CDATA[onclick]]></code> handler and the <code><![CDATA[onkeyup]]></code> handler. The <code><![CDATA[onkeyup]]></code> handler will invoke the action when the Enter key is pressed. Note that the <code><![CDATA[div]]></code> element must be loaded into the DOM before it can be found and modified. This is usually accomplished by calling the script from the <code><![CDATA[onload]]></code> event of the <code><![CDATA[body]]></code> element.  The script to add the event handlers will only execute if the user agent supports and has JavaScript enabled.   </p>

					<p>The purpose of this technique is to allow users to choose to have additional information added to the text of links so that the links can be understood out of context.</p>
					<p>Some users prefer to have links that are self-contained, where there is no need to explore the context of the link. Other users find including the context information in each link to be repetitive and to reduce their ability to use a site. Among users of assistive technology, the feedback to the working group on which is preferable has been divided. This technique allows users to pick the approach that works best for them.</p>
					<p>A link is provided near the beginning of the page that will expand the link text of the links on the page so that no additional context is needed to understand the purpose of any link. It must always be possible to understand the purpose of the expansion link directly from its link text.</p>
					<p>This technique expands the links only for the current page view. It is also possible, and in some cases would be advisable, to save this preference in a cookie or server-side user profile, so that users would only have to make the selection once per site. </p>

							<p>This example uses Javascript to add contextual information directly to the text of a link. The link class is used to determine which additional text to add. When the "Expand Links" link is activated, each link on the page is tested to see whether additional text should be added.</p>

					<p>This purpose of this technique is to allow the author to use JavaScript to apply CSS, in order to make the focus indicator more visible than it would ordinarily be.

					<p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate the display of an error message when client side validation of a form field has failed. Anchor elements are used to display the error messages in a list and are inserted above the fields to be validated. Anchor elements are used in the error messages so that focus can be placed on the error message(s), drawing the user's attention to it. The <att>href</att> of the anchor elements contain an in-page link which references the fields where error(s) have been found. </p>
					<p>In a deployed application, if Javascript is turned off, client side validation will not occur. Therefore, this technique would only be sufficient in situations where scripting is relied upon for conformance or when server side validation techniques are also used to catch any errors and return the page with information about the fields with errors. </p>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<eg-group>
						<description>
							<p>This example validates required fields as well as fields where a specific format is required. When an error is identified, the script inserts a list of error messages into the DOM and moves focus to them.</p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a way for users to stop scrolling content when the scrolling is created by a script. Scrolling content can be difficult or impossible to read by users with low vision or with cognitive disabilities. The movement can also be distracting for some people making it difficult for them to concentrate on other parts of the Web page. </p>

						<p>Calculating size and position can be complex and different browsers can produce different results. This can occur when the CSS styling mixes padding, margins and widths for an object, or when it mixes an offset and plain value, e.g., offsetWidth and width. Some of these behave differently in reaction to zooming. See <loc
							xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250395(VS.85).aspx#cssenhancements_topic3">MSDN: Fix the Box Instead of Thinking Outside It</loc> for an explanation of the way that Internet Explorer 6 and later differ from earlier versions of Internet Explorer. </p>
					</ua-issue>
				</ua-issues>
				<description>
					<p>The objective of this technique is to calculate the size and position of elements in a way that will scale appropriately as the text size is scaled. </p>
					<p>There are four properties in JavaScript that help determine the size and position of elements: </p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p><code><![CDATA[offsetHeight]]></code> (the height of the element in pixels) </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p><code><![CDATA[offsetWidth]]></code> (the width of the element in pixels) </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p><code><![CDATA[offsetLeft]]></code> (the distance of the element from the left of its parent (offsetParent) in pixels) </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p><code><![CDATA[offsetTop]]></code> (the distance of the element from the top of its parent (offsetParent) in pixels) </p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
					<p>Calculating the height and width using <code><![CDATA[offsetHeight]]></code> and <code><![CDATA[offsetWidth]]></code> is straightforward, but when calculating an object's left and top position as absolute values, we need to consider the parent element. The <code><![CDATA[calculatePosition]]></code> function below iterates through all of an element's parent nodes to give a final value. The function takes two parameters; <code><![CDATA[objElement]]></code> (the name of the element in question), and the offset property (<code><![CDATA[offsetLeft]]></code> or <code><![CDATA[offsetTop]]></code>): </p>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<eg-group>
						<description>
							<p>The Javascript function:</p>
						</description>
						<code><![CDATA[
function calculatePosition(objElement, strOffset)
{
    var iOffset = 0;

    if (objElement.offsetParent)
    {
        do 
        {
            iOffset += objElement[strOffset];
            objElement = objElement.offsetParent;
        } while (objElement);
    }

    return iOffset;
}

						<description>
							<p>The following example illustrates using the function above by aligning an object beneath a reference object, the same distance from the left: </p>
						</description>
						<code><![CDATA[
// Get a reference object
var objReference = document.getElementById('refobject');
// Get the object to be aligned
var objAlign = document.getElementById('lineup');

objAlign.style.position = 'absolute';
objAlign.style.left = calculatePosition(objReference, 'offsetLeft') + 'px';
objAlign.style.top = calculatePosition(objReference, 'offsetTop') + objReference.offsetHeight + 'px';

				<description>
					<p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to invoke a scripting function in a way that is keyboard accessible by attaching it to a keyboard-accessible control. In order to ensure that scripted actions can be invoked from the keyboard, they are associated with "natively actionable" HTML elements (links and buttons). The onclick event of these elements is device independent. While "onclick" sounds like it is tied to the mouse, the onclick event is actually mapped to the default action of a link or button. The default action occurs when the user clicks the element with a mouse, but it also occurs when the user focuses the element and hits enter or space, and when the element is triggered via the accessibility API.</p>
					<p>This technique relies on client-side scripting. However, it is beneficial to provide a backup implementation or explanation for environments in which scripting is not available.  When using anchor elements to invoke a JavaScript action, a backup implementation or explanation is provided via the <att>href</att> attribute. When using buttons, it is provided via a form post. </p>

							<p>Link that runs a script and has no fallback for non-scripted browsers. This approach should only be used when script is relied upon as an Accessibility Supported Technology.</p>
							<p>Even though we do not want to navigate from this link, we must use the href attribute on the <el>a</el> element in order to make this a true link and get the proper eventing. In this case, we're using "#" as the link target, but you could use anything. This link will never be navigated.</p>
							<p>The "return false;" at the end of the doStuff() event handling function tells the browser not to navigate to the URI. Without it, the page would refresh after the script ran. </p>

					<p>Some Web pages display scrolling text because there is limited space available. Scrolling the text in a small text window makes the content available for users who can read quickly enough, but causes problems for users who read more slowly or use assistive technology.

The text may be made available in a separate window or in a (larger) section of the page. Users can then read the text at their own speed. </p>

				<description>
					<p>Site designers often want to create dialogs that do not use the pop-up windows supplied by the browser. This is typically accomplished by enclosing the dialog contents in a <el>div</el> and placing the <el>div</el> above the page content using z-order and absolute positioning in CSS. </p>
					<p>To be accessible, these dialogs must follow a few simple rules. </p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p>Trigger the script that launches the dialog from the <code><![CDATA[onclick]]></code> event of a link or button.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Place the dialog <el>div</el> into the Document Object Model (DOM) immediately after the element that triggered it. The triggering element will maintain focus, and inserting the dialog content after that element will make the content inside the dialog next in the screen-reader reading order and next in the tab order. The dialog can still be absolutely positioned to be elsewhere on the page visually. This can be done either by creating the dialog in the HTML and hiding it with CSS, as in the example below, or by inserting it immediately after the triggering element with script. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Ensure that the HTML inside the dialog div meets the same accessibility standard as other content.</p>
						</item>
					</olist>
					<p>It is also nice, but not always necessary, to make the launching link toggle the dialog open and closed, and to close the dialog when the keyboard focus leaves it. </p>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<eg-group>
						<head>An options button that opens a dialog</head>
						<description>
							<p>The HTML for this example includes a triggering Element, in this case a button, and a div that acts as the frame for the dialog. </p>
							<p>The triggering element is a button and the script is triggered from the onclick event. This sends the appropriate events to the operating system so that assistive technology is aware of the change in the DOM. </p>
							<p>In this example, the Submit and Reset buttons inside the dialog simply hide the <el>div</el>. </p>
