      <head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that any non-speech sounds are low enough that a user who is hard of hearing can separate the speech from background sounds or other noise foreground speech content. 
            
          </p>
      <p>The value of 20 dB was chosen based on Large area assistive listening systems (ALS): Review and recommendations <bibref ref="LAALS"/> and In-the-ear measurements of interference in hearing aids from digital wireless telephones <bibref ref="HEARING-AID-INT"/>
