      <p>This version of CSS techniques has not significantly changed since the 19 November 2004 Working Draft. The <loc href="/WAI/GL/">Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</loc> (WCAG WG) has focused on addressing issues related to Guidelines and Success Criteria. This publication  demonstrates how the different documents may link to each other. As the focus of the WCAG WG returns to techniques and test suites, the structure and presentation of the techniques documents will likely change to  reflect the relationships between Guidelines, Techniques, and testing documents. In future revisions, we expect to distinguish between techniques required for conformance versus those that are optional. Please refer to "<loc href="http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/css_issues.php">Issue tracking for WCAG 2.0 Techniques for CSS</loc>" for a list of open issues related to this Working Draft.

    <abstract>
      <p>This document provides information to Web content developers who wish to satisfy the Success Criteria of "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0" <bibref ref="WCAG20"/> (currently a W3C Working Draft).   The techniques in this document are specific to Flash content <bibref ref="SILVERLIGHT"/>.  Use of the illustrative techniques provided in this document may make it more likely for Web content to demonstrate conformance to WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria (by passing the relevant tests in the WCAG 2.0 test suite - <emph>to be developed</emph>) than if these illustrative techniques are not used.</p>
      <p>There may be other techniques besides those provided in this document that may be used to demonstrate conformance to WCAG 2.0; in that case, it is encouraged to submit those techniques to the WCAG WG for consideration for inclusion in this document, so that the set of techniques  maintained by the WCAG WG is as comprehensive as possible. Deprecated examples illustrate techniques that the Working Group no longer recommends, but may be applicable in some cases. </p>
      <p>This document is part of a series of documents published by the W3C
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to support WCAG 2.0.</p>

        <p>Microsoft Silverlight is a development platform for applications.
          To learn more about Silverlight and how Microsoft defines and markets
          the Silverlight technology, see <loc href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/what-is-silverlight/">What
          Is Silverlight? document on microsoft.com</loc>. </p>
        <p>Once an application author produces a Silverlight application, the
          most common way to deploy that application is to present the Silverlight
          content using a browser plug-in that end users have installed on their
          computers. The Silverlight plug-in is instantiated within an HTML page
          as an &lt;object&gt; or &lt;embed&gt; tag.   &lt;object&gt; tag attributes
          reference Silverlight's unique classid, and/or its MIME type, thus
          invoking a plug-in instance within the browser host's HTML content.
          Users request the Silverlight-containing page as a URL, and the surrounding
          HTML plus the Silverlight content is viewed within a browser host such
          as Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Safari. There are
          other means by which Silverlight-developed content can be deployed
          that are NOT viewed in the plug-in or hosted by HTML; this is discussed
          in the upcoming section "Browser Host Platform Considerations". </p>
        <p>The content that is displayed within the Silverlight content area
          is specified as the "source" parameter, within the Silverlight
          object/embed tag. The "source" parameter value references
          a URI for a package. The package is typically served by the same server
          that served the HTML (and the package itself is typically requested
          through http: or https: protocol). The package always contains an application
          manifest, and a managed code compiled DLL. The package might also contain
          other content, for example media files or image files that the application
          consumes as resources. The compiled DLL typically contains two types
          of information within its compiled structure: CLR runtime code that
          handles dynamic operations of the application such as startup logic,
          business rules, event handlers, and further resources. The resources
          inside the DLL are primarily UI definitions in a markup format/language
          called XAML. </p>
        <p>Silverlight provides a combination of built-in support for accessibility
          and capabilities that authors and authoring tools can take advantage
          of in order to enable support for accessible content. Tools and related
          technologies that are related to this include: </p>
        <ulist><item><p> Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (or Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
            if still developing for version 3 of the Silverlight runtime) – Silverlight authors
            can use Express versions if their development needs are fairly basic </p></item><item><p> Microsoft Expression products, in particular Microsoft Expression
            Blend </p></item><item><p> Silverlight Tools – a separate package for Visual Studio that
            should be installed for effective Silverlight application development </p></item><item><p> Developer tools that are specifically for verification of information
            presented to either the UIA or MSAA accessibility frameworks. </p></item></ulist>

    		<head> Accessibility Frameworks </head>
        <p>Silverlight support for assistive technologies is based on implementing
          Silverlight for Microsoft UI Automation (often abbreviated as UIA).
          In the UIA accessibility framework, Silverlight is implemented as a
          UI Automation server. This means that Silverlight provides information
          about the application itself and its current content through the framework.
          Any subscriber to the operating system's automation can consume that
          information as a UI Automation client. One such client role is typically
          implemented by assistive technologies, most notably by screen readers.
          By acting as a UI Automation client, an assistive technology can programmatically
          determine many aspects of Silverlight content and content structure.
          In addition, UIA has APIs that can change the content in a predictable
          way that maintains security boundaries between applications. Reading
          information from Silverlight through the UIA accessibility framework
          requires no extra work on the part of a given assistive technology,
          presuming that the assistive technology has already implemented UIA.
          All information that Silverlight reports to UIA comes through the common
          property set, and a fixed set of possible user interactions is programmatically
          accessible through a discoverable set of automation patterns and techniques. </p>
        <p>As an example of how UI Automation might provide information to an
          assistive technology, consider the following scenario: </p>
        <olist><item><p> A Silverlight application author produces an application that
            follows all Microsoft-documented best practices for providing accessibility
            information, either by specific programming actions or by relying
            on a known set of Silverlight default behaviors (many of these actions/behaviors
            are also described as Silverlight WCAG techniques). </p></item><item><p> A user views a Web page that contains Silverlight content, using
            a browser host that loads the HTML, and using an operating system
            such as Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista or Windows 7) that supports
            UI Automation. </p></item><item><p> An assistive technology that is already running on the user's
            system loads the UIA representation of all Web content loaded by
            the browser. Part of that representation is an automation element
            that represents the Silverlight plug-in. The plug-in content area
            itself is focusable in the browser host's HTML rendering and representation
            model. </p></item><item><p> The user navigates elements in the Silverlight application area,
            either by using the TAB sequence, or by using navigation techniques
            implemented by a particular assistive technology. </p></item><item><p> By forwarding information that is pertinent to either the navigated-to
            element or the application in general, the accessibility framework
            provides the assistive technology with the information from Silverlight
            application. As a specific example, a screen reader might read the
            name and role of the currently focused control element such as a
            Silverlight <obj>TextBox</obj>. In addition, the assistive
            technology can provide means to enter data or otherwise interact
            with elements of that application, if that element reports to UIA
            that it supports such interaction. </p></item></olist>
        <p>A good introductory topic on UI Automation is available on <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms747327.aspx">MSDN</loc>. </p>
        <p>UI Automation supersedes Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), an
          earlier Microsoft accessibility framework. UI Automation provides built-in
          bridging support for MSAA, such that assistive technologies that are
          implemented as clients for MSAA rather than UIA receive the expected
          interface hooks for IAccessible and can call methods of the MSAA interfaces.
          Also, applications that provide MSAA/ IAccessible are readable to a
          UIA-client assistive technology through similar bridging. </p>
        <p>Whether implemented as clients for UI Automation or for MSAA, support
          for assistive technologies is provided for users viewing content using
          combinations of: </p>
        <ulist><item><p> Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or later, in combination with Microsoft
            Silverlight on Windows. </p></item><item><p> Mozilla Firefox 3 or later, in combination with Microsoft Silverlight
            on Windows. </p></item><item><p> Google Chrome 4 or later, in combination with Microsoft Silverlight
            on Windows </p></item></ulist>
        <p>Screen reader assistive technology support for either MSAA or UIA
          is provided in several assistive technologies, including but not limited
          to: </p>
        <ulist><item><p> JAWS </p></item><item><p> Windows-Eyes </p></item><item><p> NVDA </p></item><item><p> Microsoft Narrator </p></item></ulist>
        <p>The exact level of support to assistive technologies will partially
          depend on whether that assistive technology is implemented as a UIA
          client or an MSAA client. This can vary depending on specific version
          releases of the assistive technology. In general, the UIA architecture
          is capable of reporting a richer information set to clients than is
          MSAA. This is because UIA has a larger number of properties available,
          and also because UIA has the patterns concept to support class extension
          whereas MSAA does not (class extension is a key concept in Silverlight
          programming). </p>
        <p>Silverlight uses UI Automation support as a general system that addresses
          parts or entireties of many WCAG criteria at a system/platform level,
          rather than requiring each Silverlight author to build the entirety
          of such support as an individually coded feature of a Silverlight application.
          The following is a list of criteria where UI Automation support in
          Silverlight is necessary to apply the Silverlight WCAG techniques,
          and the application must be on a client and platform that also supports
          UIA (or MSAA): </p>

        <p><loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html">Success
            Criterion 4.1.2 (Name Role Value)</loc> directly influenced the design
            of both the Microsoft UI Automation accessibility framework and its
            MSAA predecessor. Many aspects of providing name, role and value
            are built-in to the Silverlight UIA support, and that information
            can be programmatically determined by assistive technologies that
            are programmed as UI Automation clients. </p>
    				<div5 id="silverlight_notes_frameworks_nrv_name">
        <head> Name </head>
        <p>In most cases, the name of the control is used to identify that control
          to users, as well as providing a programmatic identifier. In UI Automation
          programming, any entity that can have a name is represented as an <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.aspx">AutomationElement</loc>,
          and its name is determined by reading the value of the <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.name.aspx">AutomationElementInformation.Name
          property</loc>. There is an intermediate "Current" property,
          so an example usage is something like: </p>
        <p><code>string AName = anAutomationElement.Current.Name;  </code></p>
          <p><prop>Name</prop> is the most common UI Automation property
            that is consumed by assistive technologies. Application authors in
            general that rely on UI Automation (and Silverlight application authors
            in particular) typically provide strings for <prop>Name</prop> that
            can inform users of the purpose that the element serves in the application.
            For example, if an application provides a button that can be activated,
            the <prop>Name</prop> reported to UI Automation could best describe
            its purpose by using a <prop>Name</prop> string something like "Submit
            form". While there is some crossover here with the concept of
            Value, what is notable about <prop>Name</prop> is that it is
            controlled only by the application rather than typical means of user
            input that would alter the data of Value. </p>
        <p>Because UI Automation is also used as a framework for automation testing
          of applications, UI Automation supports a parallel identification property
          named <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.automationid.aspx">AutomationId</loc>. <prop>AutomationID</prop> is
          not relevant to accessibility support scenarios, although in practice <prop>Name</prop> and <prop>AutomationID</prop> sometimes
          use the same string values, or are supported by parallel property-forwarding
          techniques by implementing technologies. The intended design difference
          between <prop>AutomationId</prop> and <prop>Name</prop> is
          the following: </p>
        <ulist><item><p> <prop>AutomationID</prop> is not intended to be human readable,
            but is intended to be unique </p></item><item><p> <prop>Name</prop> is intended to be human readable but might
            not be unique </p></item></ulist>
        <p>Silverlight in particular has a property-forwarding technique whereby
          the Silverlight-specific <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.frameworkelement.name%28VS.95%29.aspx">Name</loc> or <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189028%28VS.95%29.aspx">x:Name</loc> properties
          are promoted as the initial <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.name.aspx">AutomationElementInformation.Name</loc>.
          This forwarding is implemented within build procedures to provide a
          fallback for testing and initial development of an application's UI
          Automation representation. In many cases a forwarded Name/x:Name does
          not result in a particularly human-comprehensible or user-actionable
          string or phrase. Silverlight application authors should use a test-based
          methodology to examine all possible <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.name.aspx">AutomationElementInformation.Name</loc> values
          exposed by their application, and assure that each such string is specifically
          replaced by a UI-specific <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationproperties.name%28VS.95%29.aspx">AutomationProperties.Name
          value</loc>. </p>
    				</div5>
    				<div5 id="silverlight_notes_frameworks_nrv_role">
        <head> Role </head>
        <p>Role in UI Automation can be determined through several techniques. </p>
        <p>The most straightforward technique for determining a given AutomationElement's
          role is to check the value of <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.controltype.aspx">ControlType</loc>.
          This value provides an enumeration that reports role as several known
          possibilities plus an alternate role of "Custom" if no enumeration-defined
          role is a good descriptor. For example, a Silverlight <obj>Button</obj> control
          describes itself to UI Automation as a ControlType of <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.controltype.button.aspx">Button</loc>,
          and a Silverlight <obj>TreeView</obj> describes itself as <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.peers.automationcontroltype%28VS.95%29.aspx">Tree</loc>. </p>
        <p>For further information on roles, UI Automation clients can query
          an AutomationElement to see which UI Automation patterns that element
          supports. The patterns describe expectations of the interaction model,
          and the patterns themselves expose the methods that clients should
          call to engage that interaction. For more information, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms741836.aspx">Get
          Supported UI Automation Control Patterns on MSDN</loc>. </p>

        <head> Value </head>
        <p>In MSAA, the "Value" concept was addressed by the simple
          property <prop>Value</prop> and had to be represented as a string.
          One of the major refinements of UIA over MSAA is to expand what types
          of data can be expected to exist as a value. For this reason, determining "Value" requires
          a larger understanding of UI Automation and how to access UI Automation
          patterns exposed by each peer, and is not discussed further in this
          document. For more information, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms741836.aspx">Get
          Supported UI Automation Patterns</loc> and <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms746719.aspx">UI
          Automation Control Patterns for Clients</loc>. The most basic concept
          of Value is often represented by the <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.valuepattern.aspx">ValuePattern</loc>,
          but UI Automation clients should be aware of the larger range of patterns
          that can possibly return or provide a value. In general, the UIA Value
          pattern is only relevant for setting the value directly, such as in
          a text box where a user types or otherwise inputs a string or phrase. </p>
        <p>State is also a related concept to value. UI Automation elements typically
          report states that make sense given their role, and such state is reported
          in the provider implementations. There are also some generalized state
          properties available in any automation element. Examples of these include: <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.haskeyboardfocus.aspx">HasKeyboardFocus</loc>; <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationelement.automationelementinformation.isoffscreen.aspx">IsOffscreen</loc>. </p>

        <head> Object Tree Concepts and UI Automation Tree Views </head>
        <p>The object tree is composed of all the programming constructs that
          a Silverlight application author explicitly declares by writing XAML
          UI definitions (which are initially loaded by the Silverlight runtime)
          and by invoking run-time code. The relationships between nodes in XAML
          markup, and the declaration order of peer elements in XAML, create
          identical relationships/orders in the object tree representation. In
          code, order is made explicitly by using structured definitions and
          APIs of various types of collections (list, dictionaries, etc.) that
          are common in .NET Framework programming. For example, to get the first
          child of a StackPanel named myPanel, call myPanel.Childen[0]
          (.NET collections are zero-index based). Parent-child relationships
          are declared by how specific properties are set. For example, to add
          a   "newButton" child element to myPanel as the last child,
          call myPanel.Children.Add(newButton). </p>
        <p>An object tree representation forms the basis of the Silverlight run-time
          programming model, and enables programmatic access to every programming
          entity or element part of a running Silverlight application. The object
          tree representation is particularly useful for accessibility frameworks,
          and in turn for assistive technologies that use the accessibility framework
          as a client. The relationships and item order in the object tree also
          define the default reading order, as well as the default tab sequence
          for default Silverlight key handling. The Silverlight plug-in code
          that renders Silverlight content into the plug-in display area is literally
          reading the same run-time object tree that is being simultaneously
          reported to the accessibility frameworks or other subsystems of Silverlight
          (for example, printing APIs). </p>
        <p>Silverlight supports UI Automation (UIA) as its primary accessibility
          framework on Windows platform. Silverlight also provides accessibility
          information to MSAA, by reporting information through the UIA-MSAA
          bridge. By using the APIs of the relevant accessibility framework,
          assistive technologies and other accessibility framework clients can
          discover the information and relationships declared in a Silverlight
          application's runtime object tree. The accessibility framework APIs
          work against the UI automation tree in a manner that does not require
          any specific knowledge of the Silverlight programming model. For example,
          the UI Automation APIs use an abstraction of a <obj>UIAutomationElement</obj> to
          represent any accessible Silverlight object. By calling UI Automation
          APIs against this abstracted object, accessibility framework clients
          can determine any child elements and their count, check parent elements,
          can obtain name/role/value of that <obj>UIAutomationElement</obj>,
          and so on. In fact, Silverlight accessibility support in general is
          achieved without assistive technologies even being aware that Silverlight
          is a distinct technology from HTML. This is because Silverlight implements
          its accessibility framework support such that Silverlight dovetails
          into the surrounding HTML content through the connection point of the "SilverlightControl" <obj>UIAutomationElement</obj> that
          exists within the browser host's HTML content. </p>

        <head> An Object Tree / UI Automation Example </head>
        <p>In the following XAML example, a Silverlight <obj>StackPanel</obj> is
          the container element for four different Button elements. In the visible
          user interface, the resulting buttons are oriented vertically, with
          the first declared button vertically above the others and first in
          the tab sequence. (Event handling logic for each button is not shown
          and is not relevant for the example.) </p>
        <p><code><![CDATA[<StackPanel Orientation="Vertical" >
  <Button>Hit</Button>
  <Button>Stay</Button>
  <Button>Split</Button>
  <Button>Double Down</Button>
</StackPanel>
]]></code></p>
          <p>The following image shows the resulting render order. Note the first
            “Hit” button has the blue border as focus indicator; focus was placed
            here by traversing the default tab order, and this element was the
            first Silverlight element that captured the focus. </p>
        <p><image><img source="/WAI/GL/WCAG20/Techniques/working-examples/silverlight/stackpanelbuttonsorder.png" height="98" width="277"/><alt>Image:StackPanelButtonsOrder.png</alt></image> </p>
        <p>The following is the same UI as defined in C# code rather than XAML.
          The key concept here is that each call to a Silverlight collection <function>Add</function> method
          adds that item to the end of the existing collection. Thus, to define
          a collection’s order, add the intended first item with the first
          call to <function>Add</function>, the second item in the next line of code,
          and so on. This code is analogous to what a XAML parser does when it
          processes the previous XAML example, and results in the same visible
          UI and same default tab order. </p>
    					<p><code><![CDATA[ void MakeUI()
 {
   StackPanel sp = new StackPanel() { Width = 300, Orientation = Orientation.Vertical };
   Button hitButton = new Button() { Content = "Hit" };
   Button stayButton = new Button() { Content = "Stay" };
   Button splitButton = new Button() { Content = "Split" };
   Button doubleDownButton = new Button() { Content = "DoubleDown" };
   sp.Children.Add(hitButton);
   sp.Children.Add(stayButton);
   sp.Children.Add(splitButton);
   sp.Children.Add(doubleDownButton);
 }

          <p>The following is a screenshot of the UI Automation subtree specifically
            in the area of the UI as declared by either the XAML or C# shown

        <p>Silverlight implements UI controls that support keyboard input methods

          system framework such that application authors and control authors
          can provide similar mouse-keyboard equivalence from their own UI, by
          using the Silverlight event system and sending each event to the same
          or similar handling logic. Silverlight application authors can control

        <p>Silverlight is often used to display video. Silverlight and the media
          formats it supports can include embedded text tracks with timing markers.
          The text tracks and timing markers enable a Silverlight technique that
          can provide closed captions or subtitles in any language. Silverlight

        <p>Silverlight supports text resize through browser zoom, as described

          Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support
          zoom</loc>. The effects of invoking browser zoom apply any resize to
          the entirely of the hosted HTML (including Silverlight content). Silverlight
          interaction with browser zoom is further discussed in the Silverlight
          WCAG technique <specref ref="SL22"/>. </p>
        <p>However, not all browser hosts that are supported by Silverlight provide
          browser zoom as a feature, and in the Firefox implementation the text
          within the Silverlight content area is not affected if the user has
          checked Zoom Text Only. As an alternative or additional technique for
          text resize, the Silverlight WCAG technique <specref ref="SL23"/> describes
          how to use Silverlight APIs to resize text elements that are specifically
          within the Silverlight content area. </p>
        <p>Silverlight supports a high-contrast detection mode at the platform

          and appearance techniques to select a color scheme that is appropriate
          for high contrast. This concept is shown in the Silverlight WCAG technique <specref ref="SL13"/>. Silverlight and its

          HTML by a browser host application (settings under General / Appearance

        <head> Browser Host Platform Considerations </head>
        <p>Depending on the browser host being targeted, Silverlight is implemented
          as an ActiveX control or as an NPAPI plugin. When a user installs Silverlight,
          they are installing both of these implementations, such that the same
          Silverlight installation could be accessed by an Internet Explorer
          browser host and a Firefox browser host, and could even be accessed
          simultaneously by both. Differences between the program access layers
          of ActiveX versus NPAPI, and also browser-specific differences in program
          access layers, produce some platform differences that occasionally
          relate to accessibility support. For example, there can be slight differences
          in whether the program access layer will correctly forward certain
          keys or key combinations, which might impact keyboard-mouse equivalence
          implementations. </p>
        <p>Silverlight also supports modes that do not rely on a browser host
          at all. In previous releases of Silverlight, Silverlight was defined
          as a platform for producing rich Internet applications. This is still
          true, but in the current Silverlight release the deployment options
          are expanded such that a Silverlight application is not necessarily
          a web-based application, and Silverlight is not exclusively a Web content
          technology. </p>
        <p>Silverlight supports an out of browser deployment mode. Through UI
          in an initial Web-based Silverlight application, the user is asked
          to conform whether they wish to install the out-browser application.
          If the user approves the installation, the Web-based Silverlight application
          shuts down and the installation begins. Typically, the application
          restarts itself immediately after the installation. Once installed
          on the user's hard disk, a Silverlight out-of-browser functions more
          as an application window under the control of the current platform
          operating system. This is manifested through technical aspects such
          as a change in programming security boundaries, and addition of operating-system-specific
          application model features for the Silverlight out-of-browser application.
          Examples of the latter include icons and presence in running-application
          UI metaphors such as task bars. Out-of-browser mode is not specifically
          mentioned in the Silverlight WCAG techniques, because in this mode
          Silverlight is no longer a Web application. However, an out-of-browser
          Silverlight application can include an embedded control that is itself
          capable of displaying HTML. In this situation, Silverlight accesses
          basic HTML browser frameworks provided by the platform, and any techniques
          that would normally apply to HTML content and Web content could also
          apply to the HTML as viewed within a Silverlight out-of-browser application.
          For more information, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd550721%28VS.95%29.aspx">MSDN</loc>. </p>
        <p>Silverlight is also a development platform that can be used to create
          applications for Windows Phone. While these applications often rely
          on Internet connectivity, these applications are run in the context
          of an application directly under the Windows Phone operating system,
          rather than being run in an intermediate Web host that serves as a
          generalized Web browser for Windows Phone. Therefore the typical considerations
          of Silverlight acting as a part of a larger definition of Web content
          do not apply. For more information on Silverlight for Windows Phone
          development, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff402528%28VS.92%29.aspx">The

    		<div3 id="silverlight_notes_xaml">
        <head> The XAML Language </head>
        <p>XAML is an abbreviation for eXtensible Application Markup Language.
          In the Silverlight application model, XAML is generally used for defining
          the elements that make up an application's user interface (UI). XAML
          markup for UI resembles markup paradigms for HTML in that it uses angle
          brackets in its syntax, has concepts of elements and attributes, and
          uses a predominately text-based file editing and storage format such
          that XAML is human-readable in a text editor. The UI design role typically
          designs an application user interface by interacting with graphical
          user interface tools such as Microsoft Expression Blend. In this case,
          Expression Blend produces XAML as its output, and XAML becomes the
          interchange format between the Expression Blend tool and the Visual
          Studio tools. Visual Studio is more typically used by code-oriented
          Web developers for Silverlight. Web developers in Visual Studio might
          work with XAML at the text level, and write or change the XAML markup,
          and more than one interchange between tools and/or roles of a given
          XAML file might occur by the time the application is finished. The
          Silverlight techniques are written from the perspective of the code-oriented
          Web developer who is possibly adjusting post-design phase XAML. </p>
        <p>One key difference between HTML and XAML is that XAML is always interpreted
          by the Silverlight runtime, or preparsed at compile time within Silverlight
          tools. XAML is NOT parsed by potentially different engines per browser
          host. Because XAML provides UI definition, the Silverlight techniques
          often include procedures or concepts that adjust the elements and attributes
          of XAML markup for an application. Some of the techniques show procedures
          or concepts for code-behind, scripting, deployment steps, or other
          aspects of Silverlight programming in addition to or instead of XAML
          examples. The runtime parsing characteristics of XAML for Silverlight
          is discussed further in the Silverlight WCAG technique <specref ref="SL33"/>. </p>
        <p>XAML attributes sometimes specify strings that are visible in UI and
          reported to assistive technologies. The Silverlight WCAG techniques
          typically hard-code such UI strings in XAML, so that the example code
          can be kept simple and can concentrate on the immediate concept being
          illustrated. However, hard-coding UI strings in XAML is not a best
          practice for production code, because of localizion considerations.
          To learn more about producing XAML that is localization-ready, or about
          refactoring XAML to support better designer-coder-localizer workflows,

        <head> Test-based Methodology for Accessibility Support </head>
        <p>Some of the Silverlight WCAG techniques mention a concept of   "test-based
          methodology" - this section describes what is meant by that concept. </p>
        <p>In typical Web application development, there are phases that are
          a natural part of the workflow. First there is a specification phase,
          where the basic planning is performed. The next two phases are user
          interface design (often interweaved with user experience design) and
          code development. For larger applications or applications that are
          built on frameworks, the human role of designer is often separate from
          the human role of code developer/script developer. For this reason
          the UI design phase and code phase might be going on concurrently,
          and/or might be iterative. At the point where the efforts of UI design
          and code development are combined into a working application, many
          Web developers now introduce a testing phase. It is at this point that
          a test-based methodology for accessibility support becomes an appropriate
          and useful strategy. </p>
        <p>Testers for Web applications sometimes rely largely on ad hoc or experiential
          tests, but increasingly there are tools available that assist with
          the job of testing a Web site. Many of these tools focus on specific
          aspects of testing: sub-areas such as testing under specific browser
          hosts; testing with stored state or data vs. initial experience; testing
          for different form factors; etc. One such sub-area of testing is testing
          the existing accessibility support. </p>
        <p>Because Silverlight supports the UI Automation accessibility framework,
          the best tools for testing accessibility support in a Silverlight application
          are the tools that work with UI Automation as their basis. Some of
          these tools are available from Microsoft, and other such tools are
          available from third parties. </p>
        <p>In a test-based methodology, a tester should view the application
          in its UIA representation. Using tools, testers can write tests for
          certain conditions and determine whether the application as a whole
          passes or fails. For example, a scripted test could determine whether
          all the controls in a UIA view have a valid string for <prop>Name</prop>.
          No <prop>Name</prop> string would potentially cause an assistive
          technology to misrepresent that element, and could cause confusion
          for user groups that rely on a particular assistive technology view
          of an application. In cases where an application failed these kinds
          of tests, the application might be sent back to the human role of developer/script
          writer, so that the missing accessibility information can be committed
          to the application code base. Then the application can be re-tested. </p>
        <p>A test-based methodology for accessibility support works best because
          Silverlight is such an extensive development platform. Sometimes it
          is not immediately obvious to a developer that a certain property required
          for accessibility remained unset. Or perhaps that developer was expecting
          that the human design role would have introduced that information as
          part of UI definition. Only when the integration of UI design and code
          is complete is it possible to see that there is still information or
          functionality missing. When the development process includes a testing
          step wherein dedicated tests for accessibility support are committed
          in a systematic way, it is much more likely that issues can be detected
          prior to application deployment. </p>

        <head> Running Silverlight Test Files Provided with Techniques </head>
        <p>Most Silverlight WCAG Techniques reference one or more ZIP files from
          the Test Files section of the technique. These ZIP files are linked
          from the techniques and can be uploaded for testing. </p>
        <p>To run the test files, you must have Microsoft Silverlight (the client
          run-time version) installed on your computer. To install Microsoft
          Silverlight, open the following URL: <loc href="http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/">http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/</loc> .
          Follow the instruction steps on the Web page. When you install Silverlight,
          you are installing the plug-in for use by all supported browser user
          agents on that computer. In order to test techniques that rely on UIA,
          you should install Silverlight on a computer that is running Microsoft
          Windows (XP SP2; Vista; Windows 7) as the operating system. Note that
          you must be running as adminstrator in order to install Microsoft Silverlight
          on the computer. </p>
        <p>Each ZIP file contains two items: an HTML file, and a Silverlight
          package file (always has a file extension of XAP). You can run any
          given test file through the following procedure: </p>
        <olist><item><p> Click the link from the technique to download the ZIP file. </p></item><item><p> Extract all files within the ZIP file to a temporary location,
            but use a tangible location such as C:\temp rather than temporary
            Internet files. Do not attempt to open the HTML file from within
            the unextracted archive; the test will only run correctly when the
            test components are extracted from ZIP. </p></item><item><p> Go to the folder location where you extracted the files. To run
            the test based on the current system's file associations for HTML,
            open the HTML with the associated browser. Otherwise, you must open
            the specific browser you want to test under, and type or copy either
            a file:/// URL or a Windows folder path into that browser's address
            bar. </p></item><item><p> This should open the HTML page. When the HTML page opens, it instantiates
            a Silverlight plug-in within the page content, which in turn references
            the other extracted file (the XAP) as local content. </p></item><item><p> Once the content is in view, follow the remaining steps that are

        <p>The Silverlight techniques offer pre-built test files so that you

          describes the basic information that is necessary to create a project
          that incorporates sample code from a Silverlight technique. </p>
    			<div4 id="silverlight_notes_sample-code_prerequisites">
        <head> Prerequisites </head>
        <p>Creating a Silverlight application project requires that you have
          a full Silverlight application development environment installed. Although
          Silverlight applications run cross-platform, the actual development
          of Silverlight applications is done on Microsoft Windows computers.
          The computer must have Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or Microsoft Visual
          Studio 2010 installed. With some limitations, the Express SKUs of Visual
          Studio are adequate for basic Silverlight application development.
          The Express SKUs are available for 30-day evaluation from the following
          URL: <loc href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express">http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express</loc> .
          In addition to Visual Studio, you also should install the Silverlight
          Tools, which includes the Silverlight SDK. Get Silverlight Tools from <loc href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=177428">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=177428</loc>.

            based on a default template. </p>
        <p>The C# code or XAML shown in the Silverlight techniques is a usually
          a fragment that you should integrate into an existing code file or
          XAML page from the default project template. For code, you generally
          open the file page.xaml.cs from Solution Explorer, and paste the entirety
          of the example code into the body of the C# public partial class that
          you start with (this class comes from a template). For XAML, you generally
          open page.xaml from Solution Explorer and paste the entirety of the
          XAML into the &lt;Grid&gt; element. In some cases the example XAML
          is the entire XAML (you can identify this case if the example XAML
          contains one or more xmlns attributes). In this case, replace the entirety
          of the XAML. However, you may have to adjust the value of the x:Class
          attribute to properly reference your own partial class; this name is
          influenced by your own project naming in your local project and thus
          cannot be anticipated by the example code. Descibing Silverlight application
          development in its entirety is well beyond the scope of this document.

        <head> Special Considerations for WCAG 2.0 Compliance </head>
        <p>2.4.2 Page Titled - In order to meet 2.4.2, Silverlight content must
          be embedded within an HTML page that has a page title in the HTML title
          element. </p>
        <p>3.1.1 Language of Page - The language of an HTML page is established
          by the <att>Lang</att> attribute of the containing object element in HTML. However,
          Silverlight's own logic generally interprets language/culture information
          using a Microsoft .NET Framework concept of the CultureInfo object.
          This makes it important to align the HTML-level lang with any CultureInfo
          as used by Silverlight. The reason for this is that assistive technologies
          are likely to respect the top-level declaration of the <att>Lang</att> attribute
          and to not be aware of the CultureInfo considerations of embedded Silverlight
          content. Application authors can delibrately override language settings
          of a client by specifying a discrete CultureInfo in the Silverlight &lt;object&gt; parameters;
          this can be useful if the application has real-time language switching,
          if users store language preferences either locally or based on server
          information or cookies, etc. Aligning html-lang with CultureInfo and
          adjusting the CultureInfo through various means are both discussed
          in Silverlight techniques. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to show how to access an alternate
    				audio channel in a prepared media file that is played in a Silverlight <obj>MediaElement</obj>. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight supports media file formats that contains additional audio
    				channels in synchronization, beyond the two tracks for stereo audio
    				that are used by typical media player defaults. Silverlight provides
    				a dedicated <prop>AudioStreamIndex</prop> API on <obj>MediaElement</obj>,
    				so that the Silverlight application author can use Silverlight programming
    				techniques to select which audio channel to play for the user. Silverlight
    				control authors might label a UI control with text such as "Activate
    				this button to listen to an audio-only version of the media presentation" so
    				that the purpose of the media element control interface is clear to
    				the user. That way the same media control can be used to present the
    				media either as audio-video or as audio-only with alternate track depending
    				on user preference at run time. </p>
    			<p>The media formats that are supported by Silverlight are documented
    				on <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189080%28VS.95%29.aspx">MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			<section id="SL1_media_encoding">
    				<head>Media encoding</head>
    				<p>The process of encoding the media with additional audio channels is
    					not described in this technique because configuring and encoding audio
    					channels for media formats is a technique for any usage of media in
    					a computer application, not just a Silverlight-specific technique or
    					a Web technology technique. For more information on one possible procedure
    					for encoding the media in WMV format, see <loc href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=321498">Microsoft Expression Encoder Overview</loc>.
    					Often, Silverlight authors will receive the media from a third party,
    					such as a video production facility, and are not directly involved
    					with the encoding process. Silverlight authors should verify that the
    					media they are using has alternate audio tracks encoded in it. If such
    					tracks exist, Silverlight authors will need a track listing from the
    					media producer to know which of the audio tracks is intended as the
    					alternate audio. Other tracks might exist in the encoded media that
    					provide language translations of the default audio, or that serve other
    					purposes. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use the Silverlight "control
    				skinning" scenario and feature set to change the visible focus
    				indication of a control. In particular, the intent is to increase the
    				visibility of focus indication versus the appearance of a default-styled
    				control. This technique is useful both for the control sets that are
    				included in the Silverlight run time or SDK assemblies, as well as
    				for Toolkit or any third party distributed control. </p>
    			<p>The default Silverlight core controls all indicate some type of visible
    				focus indication, through their default templates. However, Silverlight
    				application authors can still use the skinning techniques to augment
    				or replace the visible focus indications for controls as used in their
    				applications. For more information on how Silverlight controls will
    				generally supply a default visual focus indicator, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc903954%28VS.95%29.aspx">Focus
    					Overview on MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight control skinning is enabled through a deliberate separation
    				of UI and logic in the Silverlight control model. Appearance of a control
    				is largely written in XAML. The logic is largely written in code (for
    				example C#) and is left unaffected when a Silverlight application author
    				provides a new control template "skin". The hooks that connect
    				the appearance and the logic are a <prop>Style</prop> property of the control (which
    				the author changes the value of, to refer to their new XAML resource)
    				and a contract of expected named entities in the XAML. The control
    				logic invokes the names of the entities/parts whenever control state
    				changes, and the expectation is that the named part provides the necessary
    				appearance as defined in XAML. Design tools such as Visual Studio or
    				Expression Blend generate copies of the default templates and parts,
    				such that Silverlight authors can modify the parts that they want to
    				change the appearance of, and still preserve the remainder of default
    				appearance and behavior of the control. </p>
    			<p>For the visible focus indicator technique, the author typically modifies
    				a single visual element that renders in layout as an overlay on top
    				of the control when it is focused, and switches the overlay to nonvisible
    				when the control is not focused. This element is a named element that
    				is typically referred to from within the XAML named state Focused,
    				which in turn is hooked up to changes in the visual state. </p>
    			<p>Note that this technique assumes that the original control author
    				provided the necessary logic event hookup, and exposed a named state
    				associated with keyboard focus to work with. If this is not the case,
    				or if the scenario is that a Silverlight author is defining their own
    				control, a different technique is needed. See <specref ref="SL7"/>. </p>
    			<section id="SL2_focus_in_silverlight">
    				<head> Focus in Silverlight </head>
    				<p>Focus in Silverlight is equivalent to the larger user interface and
    					application concept of keyboard focus. The element that has focus is
    					the element within the Silverlight object tree and programming model
    					that has first chance to process the Silverlight key events. As a more
    					tangible example that is user-centric, if a <obj>TextBox</obj> has
    					keyboard focus, then when the user presses keys on the keyboard, the
    					characters associated with the user's pressed keys will appear in the
    					TextBox. A user interface element in Silverlight can obtain keyboard
    					focus in one of three ways: </p>
    				<olist><item><p> The user uses the Silverlight tab sequence to traverse into the
    					Silverlight content and to focus a specific control. </p></item><item><p> The Silverlight application's logic calls the <function>Focus</function> method
    						programmatically to force focus to a control. </p></item><item><p> The user performs some other action, for example uses the mouse
    							to click on a control. That control's specific logic handles the
    							Silverlight input event and uses that event as stimulus to call <function>Focus</function> on
    							that control. The difference between this case and the above case
    							is that the behavior is typically built-in to that control's runtime
    							behavior, and does not require each application author to call <function>Focus</function> in
    							application code. </p></item></olist>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to adjust the volume for media
    				that is played in Silverlight applications, as implemented through
    				incorporating the Silverlight <obj>MediaElement</obj> object.
    				By default, a <obj>MediaElement</obj> will start playing its
    				media as soon as the UI loads completely AND the media source file
    				is downloaded. For details, see <specref ref="SL24"/>. </p>
    			<p>At any given time, a Silverlight <obj>MediaElement</obj> is associated
    				with exactly one media source as specified by the <prop>Source</prop> property
    				URI value. That source might be audio-only, or audio-video. The <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.mediaelement.volume%28VS.95%29.aspx">Volume</loc> property
    				of <obj>MediaElement</obj> affects the audio playback volume
    				of that particular source when it is playing. The Silverlight plug-in
    				does not have a user option that adjusts the volume of ALL Silverlight
    				applications as run within it, or a standardized user interface that
    				is always present for all uses of <obj>MediaElement</obj>. Therefore
    				it is the responsibility of Silverlight application authors to provide
    				an adequate set of user interface controls, including volume adjustment,
    				whenever the Silverlight application plays media that has an audio
    				component. </p>
    			
    		</description>
    		<examples>
    			<eg-group>
    				<head>Providing a volume control and a Mute control as part
    					of a set of user interface controls that go with a MediaElement</head>
    				<description>
    					<p>In addition to the Play Pause Stop controls, application authors can
    						also provide a dedicated control that changes the <prop>Volume</prop> property
    						of the <obj>MediaElement</obj>. The typical control for setting
    						a discrete volume is <obj>Slider</obj>, because <obj>Slider</obj> is
    						designed for input of discrete values from a range. Adjusting <prop>Volume</prop> with
    						a data bound <obj>Slider</obj> changes the volume of any actively
    						playing media, independent of the system volume or of any other audio
    						source controlled by Silverlight. For <prop>Volume</prop> as set with the <obj>Slider</obj>,
    						the <obj>Binding</obj> in XAML declares the interaction between
    						the control and the <obj>MediaElement</obj>, without requiring
    						an event handler. However, not all users will be able to interact quickly
    						with a <obj>Slider</obj>, particularly if they are not using
    						a mouse. To help these users, application authors should also include
    						a "Mute" control. Rather than setting <prop>Volume</prop> to
    						0, application authors should instead set <prop>IsMuted</prop> to
    						true. Note that <prop>Volume</prop> and <prop>IsMuted</prop> values
    						are not directly related; if <prop>IsMuted</prop> is set to true,
    						that does not set <prop>Volume</prop> to 0, nor does setting <prop>Volume</prop> to
    						zero cause <prop>IsMuted</prop> to be set true. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is use the HTML <att>Lang</att> attribute on
    				the object tag to describe each Silverlight plug-in instance on the
    				HTML hosting page as a "part" that has a different language.
    				Assistive technologies that use HTML Lang as a determinant of language
    				of parts can thus treat all Silverlight content as using that HTML
    				Lang-declared language. </p>
    			<p>Most assistive technologies that are capable of determining Language
    				for Web content will use the HTML Lang tag value as the determinant
    				of the language of the page. Assistive technologies would also use
    				HTML Lang tag values for the language of parts. HTML Lang is not specifically
    				reported in accessibility frameworks. Assistive technologies would
    				typically access the HTML DOM to get this information. This technique
    				specifically addresses this known situation regarding how ATs obtain
    				Language information from HTML rather than from accessibility frameworks
    				that otherwise report other aspects of HTML content. </p>
    			<p>In order to support different language parts that each contain Silverlight
    				content, authors declare one Silverlight object tag per continuous
    				language part region in the HTML. For example, the following HTML is
    				a simplication of HTML markup for a page that contains two Silverlight
    				content areas, the first declaring Lang as English (en), the second
    				declaring Lang as German (de): </p>

     </body>
     ]]></codeblock>
    			<p>To support communication between different Silverlight plug-in instances
    				that are hosted on the same HTML page, application authors can use
    				various techniques, including the following </p>
    			<ulist><item><p> System.Windows.Messaging APIs: this is the simplest technique,
    				and this is shown in Example 1 </p></item><item><p> Using a shared business object, and exchanging information by
    					having each Silverlight instance reference two-way data binding to
    					that business object's properties. </p></item><item><p> Exchanging information through the HTML DOM and declaring properties

    					many aspects of how Silverlight works with language and culture information
    					at run time are not determined by HTML Lang, and are instead determined

    					<p>In this example, the English user control implements a LocalMessageSender,
    						which sends asynchronous messages to the German user control. The German
    						user control has a LocalMessageReceiver, which is set to listen as

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to wrap the Silverlight <obj>Image</obj> class
    				inside a UI container class that is focusable. If the image is focusable,
    				users who use the TAB sequence to navigate content while the assistive
    				technology is active, and/or assistive technologies that construct
    				navigation structures that are based on the TAB sequence, can both
    				detect the image in navigation. The assistive technology can then associate
    				alternative text for that image within the navigation structure, and
    				report the information to the user. </p>
    			<p>Many existing assistive technologies do not construct initial navigation
    				views that are derived from UI Automation information if it is coming
    				from a non-focusable element in a Silverlight user interface. This
    				is particularly true if the assistive technology is in a navigation
    				mode that is specifically intended to help users enter information
    				into a form or similar interactive interface element; an example of
    				this situation is the Forms Mode of the JAWS screen reader. </p>
    			<p><loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.image%28VS.95%29.aspx">Image</loc> is
    				an example of a Silverlight element that is not focusable. This technique
    				and the example therein are intended to circumvent the possible omission
    				of a nonfocusable Silverlight <obj>Image</obj> element from certain
    				navigation views in existing assistive technology implementations.
    				The Silverlight <obj>Image</obj> is wrapped with a display/viewer
    				control class that is focusable. This image-wrapping control is initially
    				presented in assistive technology representations of a Silverlight
    				user interface that use only focusable elements when constructing the
    				assistive technology's representation of the application. </p>
    			<p>The image wrapper class uses the <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> property
    				to provide a short text alternative for the contained <obj>Image</obj>,
    				so that the alternative text can be read or otherwise presented by
    				assistive technologies. The Silverlight API <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> directly
    				sets <prop>Name</prop> in the UI Automation tree. The properties
    				in the UI Automation tree are reported to assistive technologies, when
    				the assistive technology implements behavior that acts as a UI Automation
    				client. <prop>Name</prop> is one of the accessibility framework
    				properties that most assistive technologies present in some way, for
    				purposes of both name and value information, and setting <prop>Name</prop> is
    				the common technique for exposing text alternatives for any other <obj>Control</obj> class
    				(for example, for a button with an image, as shown in the technique <specref ref="SL18"/>). </p>
    			<p>This technique is intended for cases where application authors deliberately
    				do not want a visible image caption for the image to be part of the
    				user interface, and the image is a part of a larger interactive user
    				interface control or page. Otherwise, if there is a visible caption,
    				authors can use <specref ref="SL26"/>. </p>

    		<description>
    			<p>The objective of this technique is to create an <obj>AutomationPeer</obj> class
    				for a custom Silverlight control. The <obj>AutomationPeer</obj> exposes
    				accessibility properties of the control in a way that abstracts the
    				Silverlight technology specifics of the control model and maps information
    				to UI Automation concepts, so that these properties can be consumed
    				by the UI Automation accessibility framework. </p>
    			<p>The AutomationPeer concept is part of the overall architecture design
    				of the UI Automation system. The peer represents a deliberate abstraction
    				of the control, such that a client can obtain pattern-based information
    				about the specific purpose and capability of a control without knowing
    				its implementation-specific object model or having to resort to using
    				a framework-specific object model API. Also, the peers run in a different
    				process than the controls they represent, which has performance and
    				security advantages. For more information on UI Automation architecture,
    				see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms747327.aspx">UI
    					Automation Overview on MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			<p>Creating a custom Silverlight control is one way that Silverlight
    				application authors can create user interface components either for
    				their own application, or as a packaged redistributable that provides
    				the control UI for third parties. Creating an automation peer for a
    				custom control reports control-specific information to the UI Automation
    				accessibility framework, and enables a custom control to participate
    				in all of the same techniques involving UI Automation that can be used
    				for a control that is distributed in the core Silverlight run time.
    				Assistive technologies can use the UI Automation accessibility framework
    				to discover the name and role of the user interface component, and
    				can get and set values by accessing UI Automation patterns. UI Automation
    				thus supports extensibility, while maintaining a discovery system for
    				names, roles and values of UI components. </p>
    			<p>Control authors associate a peer with a class by implementing a method
    				override for the class implementation. Control authors declare name
    				and role through properties that are general to any UI Automation peer.
    				Control authors expose the means to get and set values by choosing
    				to support one or more patterns that are usually associated with a
    				role. For example, a control in the role of "Button" would
    				typically support an "Invoke" pattern. A consumer of UI Automation
    				could check whether the pattern was supported and then call the pattern-based
    				method <function>Invoke</function>, which would activate the button without
    				any device input events being produced or required. </p>
    			<p>By convention, controls and their automation peers share a naming
    				pattern. For example, if a control is named <obj>Spinner</obj>, its automation
    				peer is named <obj>SpinnerPeer</obj>. However, the actual wiring for the class-peer
    				association is made in the control code by overriding <function>OnCreateAutomationPeer</function>.
    				Thus it is necessary to have access to the control code in order to
    				associate a new peer class implementation with that control. </p>
    			<p>In addition to properties, automation peers can also expose methods
    				as part of the implemented UI Automation control pattern. For example,
    				a peer implementing the Value pattern can provide an implementation
    				of the <function>SetValue</function> method. The <function>SetValue</function> method
    				can be called by a UI Automation client in order to programmatically
    				set the value of the owner control. The functionality exposed by the
    				implementation of a control pattern can be accessed either by automation-based
    				testing, or by assistive technologies. </p>

    					<p>The example implements a very simple Silverlight custom control named

    						that the UI is defined in a XAML file that serves as the default UI,
    						but any consumer of the control can change the visual appearance by
    						applying a new template. Nevertheless, the basic accessibility characteristics
    						of the control can be shaped by the control author, and can apply even
    						for cases where the visible UI is noticably different. This separation
    						between design-implementation and code-behavior is one reason for the

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to build custom visual states for
    				custom controls that include visible focus indicators in the templates
    				and parts. </p>
    			<p>The default Silverlight core controls all indicate some type of visible
    				focus indication, through their default templates. For more information
    				on how Silverlight controls will generally supply a default visual
    				focus indicator, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc903954%28VS.95%29.aspx">Focus
    					Overview on MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight control skinning is enabled through a deliberate separation
    				of visible user interface design and control logic in the Silverlight
    				control model. Control authors expect that application authors might
    				reskin their control. But control authors should provide an initial
    				default set of states, templates, etc. so that application authors
    				have a good baseline of functionality to compare with their customization.
    				Defining visible focus states for all control parts is an example of
    				such baseline functionality. In order to make the visual focus state
    				customizable, the visual state should be associated with a name. Ideally
    				that name should have a human-readable meaning that hints at its purpose,
    				but the real reason for the name is that it connects the XAML-defined
    				template (which control consumers can change) with the control logic
    				defined by the control author (which control consumers cannot change).
    				Also, the visual names and groups in the XAML should be attributed
    				on the control class, to assist design tools. The best resource for
    				general information about Silverlight control customization is <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278064%28v=VS.95%29.aspx">Silverlight
    					documentation on MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			<section id="SL7_component_parts">
    				<head>Component Parts</head>
    				<p>Some controls are created by assembling various component parts that
    					are already defined as controls either by the Silverlight run time
    					libraries or by third parties. That scenario is not really what this
    					technique is about, because in that case the focus behavior is already
    					defined by the component's template, and the control author can re-use
    					that behavior as-is or reskin it but still through the same named state
    					definition. This technique specifically addresses how to define a control
    					where the interactive surface has mouse and keyboard handling defined
    					at a lower level for the control as a whole. The actual focus region
    					is defined by the control author in that case, and the focus indicator
    					is also defined to match the behavior visually and functionally. </p>
    				
    			</section>
    			<section id="SL7_focus_indicator_design">
    				<head>Design for Focus Indicators</head>
    				<p>The general design principles for visual focus indicators are that
    					the indicators should apply a visual change to the focus region's exterior
    					margin. A common pattern is to deliberately define the visuals for
    					the control with a pre-existing blank margin for its layout slot; that
    					way when the focus indicator is applied, the focus indicator can fill
    					that margin. </p>
    				<p>The actual graphic for the visual focus indicator is typically a border
    					or shaped frame of a solid color brush with at least 1 pixel line thickness.
    					The color used for the border stands out visually from the underlying
    					control background or other elements of the control. The contrast between
    					brush for visual focus and the remainder of control should be a contrast
    					difference that is visible to users who do not distinguish the hue
    					of colors, but can distinguish the lightness/value. In many cases the
    					border is rectangular, to go along with the control's layout slot.
    					However, if the control's basic shape is a non-rectangular shape, sometimes
    					the focus indicator is designed to make a border around that shape.
    					An example of a default Silverlight control that is round and applies
    					an exterior round border as a focus indicator is a <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.radiobutton%28VS.95%29.aspx">RadioButton</loc>. </p>
    				<p>Most focus indicator designs change only the border and do not change
    					the main area of the control. One reason for this is that changes to
    					the main control are typically reserved for other interactive states
    					that also have a visual indicator. Specifically, controls need a visual
    					state that indicates that the mouse is over the control (this is termed
    					either MouseOver or Hover state). Controls that support activation
    					also have a visual state that provides feedback for activation. For
    					example, the default Silverlight <obj>RepeatButton</obj> changes
    					its <prop>Background</prop> gradient on the button field to be
    					darker blue value when the mouse is over the button, and changes to
    					an even darker value blue when the button is activated (either by clicking
    					the mouse or by pressing SPACE or ENTER with keyboard focus on the <obj>RepeatButton</obj>).
    					To see this behavior in a live sample, see <loc href="http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/Silverlight/SampleBrowser/index.htm#/?sref=System.Windows.Controls.RepeatButtonEx">RepeatButton
    						sample on MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			</section>
    			<section id="SL7_focus_indicator_logic">
    				<head>Logic for Focus Indicators</head>
    				<p>Typical logic is that the border to indicate focus is present in the
    					default template design, but with an initial value of Visibility=Collapsed.
    					Then, a visual state for focus is defined with a name that properly
    					indicates its purpose as text (example: "Focused"). In addition,
    					a state is needed that undoes whatever changes were applied for focus,
    					once focus moves to another element (for example,   "Unfocused").
    					For example, if the "Focused" state sets the value Visibility=Visible
    					on some element, the "Unfocused" state sets that value to
    					Collapsed again. Silverlight's visual state system also provides a
    					way to group related states with a factoring name (for example, "FocusStates").
    					For more information on state names and state groups in Silverlight
    					visual states, as well as learning how these states define a control
    					contract that any control consumers should follow if they reskin that
    					control, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189093%28VS.95%29.aspx">Customizing
    						the Appearance of an Existing Control by Using a ControlTemplate on
    						MSDN</loc>. </p>
    				<p>The visual state system is designed to support visual transitions
    					to states, and for that reason the visual state system is closely coupled
    					with the Silverlight animation system. By animating the transition,
    					the visual appearance changes over a time interval. Typically, if transitions
    					are used, the time interval is short, one second or less. In the case
    					of focus indicators, it is typical to not use transitions and to instead
    					make a discrete change; otherwise, the state change might be interpreted
    					by users as a lag in interface response from their system. </p>
    				<p>The states themselves are designed in XAML, but are loaded and unloaded
    					through logic that the control author defines as part of their control
    					code. The control author does this by handling the appropriate events
    					that occur while the event scope applies to their control. For example,
    					to apply the "Focused" state, the control author handles
    					the <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.uielement.gotfocus%28VS.95%29.aspx">GotFocus
    						event</loc>. Rather than handle the event directly, the more common pattern
    					is to override a virtual method that acts as a prewired event handler, <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.ongotfocus%28v=VS.95%29.aspx">OnGotFocus</loc>.
    					The centralized logic for visual state changes is the method <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.visualstatemanager.gotostate%28VS.95%29.aspx">GoToState</loc>,
    					with one of the parameters to pass representing the XAML name of the
    					correct state to load from the XAML templates. Examples for all of
    					the APIs discussed here are available in the MSDN topic <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278064%28VS.95%29.aspx">Creating
    						a New Control by Creating a ControlTemplate</loc>. </p>

    				<head>Focus in Silverlight</head>
    				<p>Focus in Silverlight is equivalent to the larger user interface and
    					application concept of keyboard focus. The element that has focus is
    					the element within the Silverlight object tree and programming model
    					that has first chance to process the Silverlight key events. As a more
    					tangible example that is user-centric, if a <obj>TextBox</obj> has
    					keyboard focus, then when the user presses keys on the keyboard, the
    					characters associated with the user's pressed keys (or possibly input
    					that is enabled by an assistive technology that can substitute for
    					key strokes) will appear in the <obj>TextBox</obj>. A user interface
    					element in Silverlight can obtain keyboard focus in one of three ways: </p>
    				<olist><item><p> The user uses the Silverlight tab sequence to traverse into the
    					Silverlight content and to focus a specific control. </p></item><item><p> The Silverlight application's logic calls the Focus() method programmatically
    						to force focus to a control. </p></item><item><p> The user performs some other action, for example uses the mouse
    							to click on a control. That control's specific logic handles the
    							Silverlight input event and uses that event as stimulus to call Focus()
    							on that control. The difference between this case and the above case
    							is that the behavior is typically built-in to that control's runtime
    							behavior, and does not require each application author to call Focus()

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a long text alternative
    				that replaces content when a short text alternative is not sufficient
    				for a given user, and the user specifically requests that the application
    				should provide more context or more information through the application
    				user interface. The technique could also apply for providing a long
    				text alternative for a nontext object, for example for an image that
    				contains a level of detail that is difficult to capture in a standard
    				visible-in-UI image caption. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight supports a UI Automation property named <prop>HelpText</prop>,
    				to connote its possible usage to provide imperative instructions for
    				interactive elements. <prop>HelpText</prop> is not always forwarded
    				to users by existing assistive technologies, which is an issue discussed
    				in the technique <specref ref="SL19"/>.
    				Rather than relying on a particular assistive technology's support
    				for enabling users to access the UIA <prop>HelpText</prop>, application
    				authors can introduce user interface elements into their design that
    				databind directly to the <prop>HelpText</prop> property, but where
    				the interface element is not necessarily displayed by default. An interface
    				update might be designed to occur if the application user specifically
    				activates a "Get Help" action that is presented in the initial
    				user interface. </p>
    			<p>This technique emphasises a "HelpText" model as a factoring
    				practice. Silverlight application authors can use the <prop>HelpText</prop> as
    				a data source that centralizes such information, because it already
    				exists and has that intended purpose in accessibility frameworks. For
    				example, the <prop>HelpText</prop> could be shown in a tooltip,
    				a popup, a separate user interface element that is deliberately rendered
    				in close proximity, etc. For accessibility support, a recommended display
    				option for <prop>HelpText</prop> is to add or dynamically alter
    				a Silverlight text element in the primary user interface. Silverlight
    				supports an adaptive layout metaphor. Adding text to the runtime elements
    				in the application generally causes an interface redraw, which in turn
    				informs assistive technologies (through UIA properties and events)
    				that content might have changed. </p>
    			<p>To set the UIA <prop>HelpText</prop> in Silverlight, you set the
    				attached property <prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop>. <prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop> can
    				be set in code, but is typically set in XAML that defines a Silverlight
    				UI. </p>
    			<section id="SL8_helptext_tooltip">
    				<head>HelpText and Tooltip</head>
    				<p>The same information that is used for <prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop> long
    					text alternatives could also be useful to sighted users. In this case,
    					the same text could be displayed in a Silverlight <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.tooltip%28VS.95%29.aspx">ToolTip</loc> control.
    					The reason that application authors should use both <prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop> AND <obj>Tooltip</obj> in
    					conjunction is because the <obj>Tooltip</obj> information is
    					not introduced into the runtime accessibility framework information
    					set by UI Automation, because that information set does not anticipate
    					the mouse action triggers that cause tooltips to display. In Silverlight
    					programming, a useful technique for sharing the same resource is to
    					combine the Silverlight data binding feature with the .NET Framework
    					embedded resource feature. For more information on combining Silverlight

    		<description>
    			<p>The objective of this technique is to handle key events in a Silverlight
    				application and enable application-specific keyboard functionality
    				in a Silverlight application. The keyboard functionality might relate
    				to a particular element of the Silverlight application user interface,
    				or might be a handler for global key events within the application,
    				such as an application-wide access key. </p>
    			<p>In Silverlight, application authors handle user input by attaching
    				event handlers for input events. The input events are implemented on
    				a class that is a base element in the Silverlight class hierarchy,
    				such that all Silverlight UI elements can be the source of an input
    				event if the user interacts with them. Typically, the event handler
    				names are specified in XAML, although it is also possible to wire events
    				in code. The implementation of the handlers for the Silverlight managed
    				code programming model is always done in C# or Visual Basic code. </p>
    			<p>The most commonly used input events are the following: </p>
    			<ulist><item><p> <event>KeyUp</event>, <event>KeyDown</event> - these are the
    				key events. Which key is pressed is determined by event parameters
    				passed to the handler. </p></item><item><p> <event>MouseEnter</event>, <event>MouseOver</event>, <event>MouseLeave</event> </p></item><item><p> <event>MouseLeftButtonDown</event>, <event>MouseLeftButtonUp</event>, <event>MouseRightButtonDown</event>, <event>MouseRightButtonUp</event> </p></item></ulist>
    			<p>Other forms of input that Silverlight supports include touch devices
    				(with mouse promotion for cases where the application runs on devices
    				that do not have touch input modes) and a related inking mode. For
    				any UI interaction that uses mouse input or these other input modes,
    				Silverlight application authors can write a parallel key event handler
    				to provide users the keyboard equivalent. </p>
    			<p>Also, the Silverlight event system and control model combine to enable
    				behavior whereby a mouse event and a keyboard event can be treated
    				as the same event and can be handled by a common event handler. Using
    				this technique, Silverlight authors can facilitate keyboard functionality
    				in custom controls or as override behavior to existing Silverlight-supplied
    				controls, and provide equivalence for mouse events or events that are
    				specific to other input devices. Silverlight authors can also use controls
    				that already have a keyboard equivalence as a built-in behavior. </p>
    			<p>The parallel key event handler case, and the built-in behavior case,
    				are each shown in one of the examples. </p>
    			<p>All input events report a specific source that is communicated to
    				handler code as an event parameter, so that the application author
    				can identify which element in their Silverlight UI was being interacted
    				with, and the application can perform an action that is relevant to
    				that user input. In the case of mouse events, the event source is the
    				element that the mouse pointer is over at the time. In the case of
    				key events, the event source is the element that has focus. The element
    				that has focus is visually indicated so that the user knows which element
    				they are interacting with (see <specref ref="SL2"/>). Assistive technologies
    				often have parallel conventions whereby the user is made aware of which
    				element is visually focused and is the current input scope presented
    				by the assistive technology, </p>

    				<head>Browser hosts and keyboard events</head>
    				<p>Silverlight is hosted as a plug-in inside a browser host. The Silverlight
    					run-time only receives the input events that the browser host forwards
    					to hosted plug-ins through a browser-specific program access layer.
    					Occasionally the browser host receives input that the browser host
    					itself handles in some way, and does not forward the keyboard event.
    					An example is that a Silverlight application hosted by an Internet
    					Explorer browser host on Windows operating system cannot detect a press
    					of the ALT key, because Internet Explorer processes this input and
    					performs the action of bringing keyboard focus to the Internet Explorer
    					menu bar. Silverlight authors might need to be aware of browser-specific
    					input handling models and not rely on key events for keys that are
    					essentially reserved for use by a browser host. For more information,
    					see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189015%28VS.95%29.aspx">Keyboard

    				<head>Other event models</head>
    				<p>This technique specifically discusses event handling for the Silverlight
    					managed programming model. However, Silverlight also supports parallel
    					models for event handling, either through a Silverlight run-time feature
    					or due to Silverlight's role as a plug-in within a script-capable browser
    					host. For example, events from the HTML DOM can be handled by JavaScript
    					at HTML scope for the overall Silverlight plug-in; this uses the browser
    					host as script processor and the Silverlight run-time is not directly
    					involved. Or, HTML DOM events can be handled through an HTML bridge
    					that calls into Silverlight application code. These event models can
    					potentially be used to provide keyboard equivalence, but it is generally
    					more convenient to use the managed code model as described in this
    					technique. For more information on other event models in Silverlight,
    					see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189018%28VS.95%29.aspx">Events

    		<examples>
    			<p>Two examples are given. The first example is for the scenario of a
    				Silverlight application author that is simply incorporating an existing
    				control into their application design, and is taking advantage of mouse-keyboard
    				equivalence that is already defined by certain Silverlight core controls.
    				The second example is from the perspective of a control author, or
    				at least that of a Silverlight application author that intends to encapsulate
    				behavior in a custom Silverlight control and use it in their own application.
    				For this second example, the control will handle the general Silverlight
    				input event <event>KeyUp</event>, in order to check for input from
    				key(s) that are designated to have a specific input meaning for that
    				control. </p>
    			<eg-group>
    				<head>Built-in keyboard equivalence for core Silverlight controls</head>
    				<description>
    					<p>This example pertains to cases where the control that handles key
    						events is focusable (through the tab sequence, etc.) and where an existing
    						Silverlight control behavior provides the keyboard equivalence In this
    						example, a Silverlight UI includes a <obj>Button</obj> element.
    						For sighted users, or users that generally use the mouse to interact
    						with UI, a typical way to interact with the button is to position the
    						mouse pointer over the element, and click the left mouse button. However,
    						the <obj>Button</obj> also supports a built-in key handling behavior,
    						whereby either the SPACE or ENTER keys are treated as an equivalent
    						action to clicking the button with a mouse. The requirement for this
    						interaction is that the <obj>Button</obj> must have keyboard
    						focus at the point in time that SPACE or ENTER are pressed. The <obj>Button</obj> might
    						gain focus because the user pressed the TAB key to move through the
    						tab sequence, or some equivalent action enabled by assistive technology.
    						In terms of the programming experience, the Silverlight application
    						author does not have to separately handle <event>KeyDown</event> for
    						this case. Within the <obj>Button</obj> control built-in code,
    						the special case of SPACE or ENTER keys pressed while a <obj>Button</obj> has
    						focus invokes the button’s <event>Click</event> event. Then the Silverlight
    						application author can simply handle <event>Click</event> without
    						differentiating whether the input action was a mouse click or a keyboard
    						equivalent. The following is the entire XAML UI. </p>

    				<head>Keyboard events for a custom control, keyboard equivalence</head>
    				<description>
    					<p>In this example, a new Silverlight custom control named SimpleNumericUpDown
    						uses a control template that includes two buttons. To provide keyboard
    						equivalence for the buttons, an event handler is defined by the control
    						class code. The event handler invokes the action in response to certain
    						accelerator keys, where these actions are equivalent to clicking the
    						button composition parts of the control with a mouse. The following
    						is the default XAML template. </p>
    					<codeblock><![CDATA[<ControlTemplate TargetType="local:SimpleNumericUpDown">
  <Border Background="{TemplateBinding Background}"
          BorderBrush="{TemplateBinding BorderBrush}"
          BorderThickness="{TemplateBinding BorderThickness}" Name="controlFrame">
      <Grid>
          <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>

    					<p>The following C# code shows the event handlers. Also, the code includes

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to declare Silverlight user interface
    				elements related to user input and use the Silverlight two-way data
    				binding techniques to provide a Submit button and opt-in forms submission
    				logic pattern for forms. The Submit button serves as the final deliberate
    				step of a form submission scenario. Silverlight programming techniques
    				do not provide a "Submit button as a distinct object. Rather,
    				application authors design their user input workflow such that it is
    				a single user action that initiates change of context that is related
    				to a data input scenario. The key to doing this in Silverlight is to
    				use a data binding mode that sets <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.binding.updatesourcetrigger%28VS.95%29.aspx">UpdateSourceTrigger</loc> of
    				all individual databound fields in that form or transaction. For any
    				data binding where the <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.binding.updatesourcetrigger%28VS.95%29.aspx">UpdateSourceTrigger</loc> is <prop>Explicit</prop>,
    				no real-time change is made to the data, until the <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.bindingexpression.updatesource%28VS.95%29.aspx">UpdateSource</loc> method
    				is called on each of these bindings. The application-specific Submit
    				button is connected to an event handler that calls <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.bindingexpression.updatesource%28VS.95%29.aspx">UpdateSource</loc> on
    				all of the databound UI elements that comprise that form. </p>
    			<section id="SL10_validation">
    				<head> Validation of data </head>
    				<p>The Submit button itself can also be the UI element that provides
    					warnings, instructions, etc. in a way that assistive technologies can
    					report to users, through the <obj>AutomationProperties</obj> techniques.
    					Using a Submit model for Silverlight form input to databound data sources
    					relies on a particular data binding mode. The Submit model can be used
    					either along with client-side or server-side validation techniques.
    					The example does not explicitly include either validation technique. </p>

    				<head>Two form fields with Submit</head>
    				<description>
    					<p>In this example, the form fields correspond to a data object that
    						implements a view model. Silverlight uses the view model and data annotations
    						to generate some of its UI, notably the names of the fields are bound
    						to the original view model names from the data. This example has a
    						UI defined in XAML and logic defined in C#. The following is the XAML
    						UI , which also includes the binding definitions. Note the Mode=TwoWay,
    						UpdateSourceTrigger=Explicit attributes in the bindings. This is the
    						binding mode to use for the Submit button scenario. </p>

    					<p>The following is the C# logic for the page. Note the <function>SubmitButton_Click</function> handler.
    						This implementation disables the Submit button (representative of
    						a change of context, because now the form cannot be submitted again)
    						and provides user feedback without performing any validation. The
    						test file included in this technique sets up its data object as a
    						purely client side entity and does no validation, so that no service/server
    						is necessary to use the test file. Each element with a binding calls
    						the <function>UpdateSource</function> method, such that the act of pressing
    						the Submit button commits all the form's information all at once.
    						A full implementation might replace this with a server side data
    						object infrastructure. A full implementation might also provide a "Reset" or "Edit" button
    						to enable form submission again if there were issues. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to associate a "Pause" or "Stop"   action
    				for a Silverlight animation with a user interface control. This enables
    				a user to pause or stop an animation in Silverlight content. </p>
    			<p>The Silverlight animation system is generalized such that nearly any
    				Silverlight property of type <obj>Double</obj>, <obj>Point</obj> or <obj>Color</obj> can
    				be animated, or a property can cycle through discrete object values.
    				Thus the possibilities for which properties in the user interface can
    				be animated are quite broad. The general technique shown can be used
    				to pause or stop any Silverlight animation, including those that are
    				purely decorative. </p>
    			<section id="SL11_pause_stop">
    				<head> Pause versus Stop </head>
    				<p>Silverlight has two discrete methods for animation control: a <function>Pause</function> method
    					and a <function>Stop</function> method. The difference in behavior is that <function>Pause</function> uses
    					whatever the last value was while the animation was still running,
    					and holds that value permanenently (unless the animation is restarted). <function>Stop</function> sets
    					the value to be whatever value existed before the animation was started.
    					However, calling <function>Stop</function> on an animation often results
    					in a behavior that looks like a "reset"   to the user; this
    					is particularly true if the animation is animating an element's position
    					on screen. In many cases, what might be a conceptual   "stop" for
    					the user is better accomplished by a "permanent Pause" in
    					the Silverlight animation API. Whether to call <function>Pause</function> or <function>Stop</function> is
    					an aesthetic decision and application authors can experiment to see
    					which behavior has the best appearance. If application authors choose
    					to use <function>Stop</function>, authors can simply replace the call to
    					.Pause() with a call to .Stop() for any code that is based on this
    					technique's example. </p>

    				enable users to pause or stop the video to prevent the video images
    				on the <obj>MediaElement</obj> surface from moving, and stop
    				video-associated audio. These UI controls enable an interaction defined

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to incorporate high contrast color
    				choices into a user interface visual design for Silverlight, by changing
    				the values of styles or templates, or changing values of individual
    				resources such as brushes or colors. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight styles and templates are produced in XAML. Silverlight
    				event handlers (such as the ones that engage the style switch) are
    				written in code, but are often wired through a method name reference
    				in the XAML. For more information on how to use templates, styles and
    				resources to change the appearance of Silverlight controls, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278068%28VS.95%29.aspx">Control
    					Customization topic on MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight provides a built-in property that can determine whether
    				the hosting operating system is using a high contrast theme. This is
    				a Boolean value only; Silverlight API cannot determine any further
    				specifics about the theme choice, such as the colors being used or
    				the contrast ratio between the colors. Querying this property at application
    				startup is one possible trigger mechanism for applying high contrast
    				themes to Silverlight content. Another mechanism is to expose a control
    				(such as a button or text link) to the user, so that the user can engage
    				high contrast for a Silverlight application's content by activating
    				a control within the Silverlight application. </p>
    			<section id="SL13_themes">
    				<head> Silverlight Toolkit themes and System Colors </head>
    				<p>An extension to the Silverlight core deliverables known as the Silverlight
    					Toolkit provides theming APIs and various themed styles for Silverlight
    					controls, including the core controls. Most of these themes are intended
    					for design purposes, but the Silverlight Toolkit also provides a System
    					Colors theme. The System Colors theme aligns the Silverlight theme
    					brushes or colors with those of the settings applied to the Microsoft
    					Windows operating system display options. When the user switches the
    					system themes to use a theme that is typically used for high contrast,
    					the underlying system brushes are redefined. A Silverlight application
    					that uses the System Colors theme also uses the now-redefined colors
    					in its UI, and will effectively use the same High Contrast colors that
    					are user-selected for all other display. How to use the Silverlight
    					Toolkit system themes is not described in this technique. However,
    					the Silverlight Toolkit theme system is a viable option for providing
    					high contrast as well as other more aesthetics-oriented UI experiences.
    					For more information about the Silverlight Toolkit, see <loc href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/">Toolkit
    						site</loc>. The themes feature of Silverlight Toolkit is best explained

    				<p><prop>SystemParameters.HighContrast</prop> is an adequate trigger

    					a trigger mechanism is that Silverlight does not detect the change
    					if it happens after the Silverlight plugin is loaded by the host HTML.
    					If Silverlight authors want to support real-time changes, they should provide a user-initiated

    					<p>The example "application" for illustration is just text,
    						a button and border. The concepts shown in the example can scale to
    						any complexity of UI, including to applications that have thousands
    						of lines of XAML. Note that the visual appearance of the button is
    						already using a high contrast theme choice for its default state, to
    						assure that the control is visible to anyone that requires a high contrast
    						theme to see parts of the user interface per <loc href="G174" linktype="techniques">G174</loc>.
    						To keep the example simple, the visual states (behaviors) associated
    						with mouse-over, click, etc. have not been restyled for high contrast.
    						Only the base appearance is changed. The example also shows a technique
    						of storing original theme information and restoring it in response

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to implement built-in handling
    				of key events in a custom control. If a custom control is correctly
    				implemented, then any Silverlight applications that include the control
    				can rely on the built-in key handling for some or all of the desired
    				keyboard equivalence of a control's functionality. </p>
    			<p>Defining a custom control requires that the control author write a
    				default template for the control and also the initialization logic,
    				including the default implementations for built-in keyboard equivalence.
    				Typically, control authors provide keyboard equivalence for any actions
    				that can be activated by a mouse click on the control surface, and
    				that are not already providing a keyboard equivalence through the implementation
    				of a composite part. </p>
    			<p>All input events report a specific source that is communicated to
    				handler code as an event parameter, so that the application author
    				can identify which element in their Silverlight UI was being interacted
    				with, and the application can perform an action that is relevant to
    				that user input. In the case of mouse events, the event source is the
    				element that the mouse pointer is over at the time. In the case of
    				key events, the event source is the element that has focus. The element
    				that has focus is visually indicated so that the user knows which element
    				they are interacting with (see <specref ref="SL2"/>). Assistive technologies
    				often have parallel conventions whereby the user is made aware of which
    				element is visually focused and is the current input scope presented
    				by the assistive technology. </p>
    			<section id="SL14_hosts">
    				<head> Browser hosts and keyboard events </head>
    				<p>Silverlight is hosted as a plug-in inside a browser host. The Silverlight
    					runtime only receives the input events that the browser host forwards
    					to hosted plug-ins through a browser-specific program access layer.
    					Occasionally the browser host receives input that the browser host
    					itself handles in some way, and does not forward the keyboard event.
    					An example is that a Silverlight application hosted by an Internet
    					Explorer browser host on Windows operating system cannot detect a press
    					of the ALT key, because Internet Explorer processes this input and
    					performs the action of bringing keyboard focus to the Internet Explorer
    					menu bar. Silverlight authors might need to be aware of browser-specific
    					input handling models and not rely on key events for keys that are
    					essentially reserved for use by a browser host. For more information,
    					see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189015%28VS.95%29.aspx">Keyboard
    						Support</loc>. </p>
    				<p>Application authors should choose keys that avoid browser conflicts,
    					but still are a natural choice for an accelerator. Using the CTRL key
    					as a modifier is a convention that is frequently used in existing Silverlight
    					applications. </p>
    			</section>
    			<section id="SL14_which-keys">
    				<head> Informing users of which keys to use for keyboard equivalence </head>
    				<p>If a control supports user interaction, which key to use to engage
    					the keyboard equivalent behavior is not always obvious. One way to
    					inform users of the possible key options that a control supports is
    					to author an <prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop> value in
    					the application UI that gives instructions such as "Press the
    					plus key to increment value". This is up to the application author
    					to do; the control definitions do not provide a means to set HelpText
    					by default, because any display technique for end user help is potentially
    					too application-specific to be encapsulated in control definitions.
    					Application authors might also consider using tooltips, providing a
    					menu framework that visually indicates the key associations (perhaps
    					with the Windows key-underlined convention), providing a generalized
    					application Help, or displaying plain text in the user interface. </p>
    			</section>
    			<section id="SL14_on-methods">
    				<head> The On* method pattern in Silverlight </head>
    				<p>Silverlight classes often have methods that follow the naming pattern <function>On*</function> where
    					the star is a string that also identifies an event. These <function>On*</function> methods
    					are prewired event handlers, defined as virtual methods so that subclasses
    					can override them. A consumer of a control class can change or augment
    					the default behavior associated with that event by overriding the method,
    					and typically also calls the base implementation so that the base functionality
    					is preserved. This principle is illustrated in Example 1 by the overrides
    					of <function>OnGotFocus</function> and <function>OnLostFocus</function>. Controls that introduce new events should
    					consider also exposing a virtual <function>On*</function> method that pairs with the event,
    					so that consumers of the custom control can use the same pattern. </p>

    					<p>This example implements a custom Silverlight control that displays
    						an integer value, and can increment or decrement the integer value
    						based on user actions. When a user interacts with the control, the
    						user can click the "+" and "-" buttons that are
    						component parts of the control. The "+" and "-" button
    						parts are deliberately not in the Silverlight tab sequence, because
    						this is intended to be a complete control, where only the control itself
    						(and not its constituent parts) are focusable and are reported as an
    						element to the accessibility framework. To provide keyboard equivalence,
    						the control defines a <event>KeyUp</event> handler. The design of
    						the control treats an Up Arrow key press as equivalent to activating
    						the "+" button, and the Down Arrow key as equivalent to activating
    						the "-" button. The control implementation reinforces this
    						behavior by having the button <event>Click</event> event handlers
    						and the cases of the <event>KeyUp</event> handler call the same underlying
    						helper functions (Increment() and Decrement()). </p>
    					<p>Handling the + and - keys as alternate or additional keyboard equivalents
    						for the actions is also possible (if that is desired, handler would
    						check for <prop>Key.Add</prop> or <prop>Key.Subtract</prop> values). </p>
    					<p>The following is the XAML-defined control template for this control.</p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to introduce key handling that
    				exists at the application root level of a Silverlight application,
    				rather than per-element key handling. Event handling at the application
    				level as opposed to at the element level is one way to address key
    				equivalence. The key events provide key equivalence for particular
    				user interface elements that a user might otherwise interact with using
    				a mouse. This technique is related to events in the Silverlight programming
    				model, as opposed to in the HTML DOM. </p>
    			<p>Handling key events at the root level of an application rather than
    				only on the element that was the "source" of a key event
    				is possible because of a Silverlight programming model feature known
    				as event routing. For more information on event routing and how it
    				works, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189018%28VS.95%29.aspx">Events
    					Overview for Silverlight</loc>. </p>
    			<p>This technique demonstrates a "menu" approach to key handling
    				and user interaction. This technique is presented as a companion to <specref ref="SL9"/>, which
    				can be thought of as an "accelerator key/hotkey" approach.
    				The   "menu" approach towards keyboard equivalence is perhaps
    				just as common as the "hotkey" approach. It is often simpler
    				to document a menu's key equivalence in a user interface than it is
    				to document key equivalents of particular regions of an application,
    				or to communicate to users that where the current focus is placed is
    				relevant to how keyboard keys are interpreted by the application, even
    				if the key action is relevant to only one of the controls in an interface.
    				If all keys are handled at the top level, the specific focused element
    				is no longer relevant. </p>
    			<p>In order to originate a key event that Silverlight application code
    				can detect, some element in the Silverlight application must have keyboard
    				focus. One way to assure keyboard focus is to focus the Silverlight
    				plug-in as a whole, as called from within an event handler for <event>Application.Startup</event>.
    				This is shown in the examples. </p>
    			<p>If an application does handle keys at top level, care should be taken
    				to not interfere with specific text entry control behavior, such as
    				typing into a <obj>TextBox</obj>. To avoid interactions, the
    				design of key equivalence at the top level of an application typically
    				relies on combinations with key modifiers. The Control/CTRL key is
    				a key that is often used for this purpose. Application authors should
    				also be aware of the implications of browser hosts that might handle
    				the key event at HTML DOM level without making that event available
    				to the Silverlight programming surface. For more information on this
    				concept, see "Keyboard Events and Browser Hosts" section
    				of <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189015%28VS.95%29.aspx">Keyboard
    					Support Overview for Silverlight on MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			<p>Application authors are responsible for correctly documenting the
    				accelerator keys that are pertinent for their application. There are
    				a variety of techniques for documenting user interface actions that
    				are not described here. One possible suggestion is to include a generalized "Help" button
    				that appears early in the application's reading order, which is focusable
    				and has an <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> value available as the text content
    				or equivalent. Such a button can be activated without knowing any of
    				the application's accelerator keys, and the activation result could
    				be a new text element that enumerates the possible keys. For example,
    				the application could display a Silverlight <obj>Popup</obj> with
    				the following content: </p>
    			<p><image><img source="/WAI/GL/WCAG20/Techniques/working-examples/SL15/popup_keys.png" height="101" width="288"/><alt>A screen shot of a sample Popup control that documents specific accelerator keys</alt></image> </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use text captioning that is
    				embedded in the stream with media displayed in a Silverlight <obj>MediaElement</obj>,
    				and present that text captioning in a separate Silverlight control
    				or text element. </p>
    			<p>This particular technique uses scripting files with a <obj>TimelineMarkers</obj> collection
    				that are embedded directly within the media file. When text captioning
    				is embedded directly in the streams, synchonization of the scripting
    				stream versus the video content stream is done automatically by the <obj>MediaElement</obj> component.
    				Each time the <event>MarkerReached</event> event fires, that is an
    				indication that a synch point in the video that corresponds to a script
    				marker entry has been reached. Silverlight application authors can
    				obtain the text from the relevant timeline marker entry through their
    				event handler implementations, and can display captions in the user
    				interface area where the text captions are displayed. Typical Silverlight
    				controls that can be used for displaying text captions include <obj>TextBlock</obj> (nonfocusable), <obj>TextBox</obj>,
    				or <obj>RichTextBox</obj>. A typical interface design would place
    				the caption-display control in close proximity to the <obj>MediaElement</obj> control
    				that is being captioned, for example might place the captions directly
    				underneath the <obj>MediaElement</obj> "screen". </p>
    			<p>Script-embedded captions are captions that are stored directly in
    				the media file as metadata, rather than as a separate file. For information
    				about techniques for captions in separate files, see <specref ref="SL28"/>. </p>
    			<section id="SL16_tools">
    				<head> Tools </head>
    				<p>Producing the media file with <obj>TimelineMarkers</obj> captions
    					directly in embedded scripting can be accomplished using the Microsoft
    					Expression Encoder tool. Online help for the procedure of encoding
    					scripting with text captions in the stream are available in the offline
    					Help file that installs with the Microsoft Expression 4 Encoder products.
    					For more information, see <loc href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=321498">Expression
    						Encoder Pro Overview</loc>.</p>
    				<p>There is a <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd743937%28VS.85%29.aspx">public
    					API</loc> for introducing Markers into a WMV file, as part of the Windows
    					Media Format SDK. Using Expression Encoder is the way that the task
    					of directly embedding <obj>TimelineMarkers</obj> is presented
    					and taught in Microsoft's available instructional material on Silverlight.
    					However, because the mechanism is public, it is possible that other
    					tools exist or will exist that can also produce media with script-encoded <obj>TimelineMarkers</obj>. </p>    			</section>

    						identification or user instructions. The most relevant part of this
    						example is that the Silverlight author declares a handler for the event <event>MarkerReached</event>.
    						This event fires potentially hundreds of times, once for each caption
    						in the stream. Each time the event fires, the event handler runs and
    						adds the text to the dedicated <obj>TextBox</obj> in the user
    						interface. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use the Silverlight <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> property
    				to provide a short text alternative for controls that do not otherwise
    				contain text. The text is intended to provide human-readable identifiers
    				and short-descriptions or user instructions for accessibility frameworks,
    				which can then be reported to assistive technologies. </p>
    			<p>"Control" in this technique refers to any element that is
    				based on the Silverlight <obj>Control</obj> class, and is keyboard-focusable
    				either by user action or calling focus to the control programmatically.
    				The non-text control in question might be something like a button that
    				communicates information using only an icon or image. For example,
    				a triangle image rotated 90 degrees clockwise is commonly used in many
    				user interfaces to indicate a "Play"   button control. This "Play" icon
    				mimics interface metaphors from many non-software consumer products,
    				and is often presented in a user interface without any nearby visible
    				text information that explains the purpose of the control. Another
    				example is a "thumbnail" metaphor where a small image serves
    				as a control that can be activated, and where the action results in
    				the display of a larger version of the same image, or enters an editing
    				mode that loads the same image. </p>
    			<p>For cases of controls such as buttons that invoke actions, the text
    				alternative also identifies link purpose. </p>
    			<p>In Silverlight, a text-only identifier for any control can be set
    				specifically as <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> on the parent
    				control. Silverlight control compositing techniques enable either per-control
    				images that are specified by the application author, or a general-purpose
    				image/icon for a control that is part of the control's template and
    				displays that way by default. The Silverlight API <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> directly
    				sets <prop>Name</prop> in the UI Automation tree. The properties
    				in the UI Automation tree are reported to assistive technologies, when
    				the assistive technology implements behavior that acts as a UI Automation
    				client (or as an MSAA client, which relies on the UIA-MSAA bridge). </p>

    				from the UI Automation tree for Silverlight in cases where the corresponding
    				UI object is not focusable in the tab sequence. This technique provides
    				the support for introducing the information into the UI Automation
    				tree for that element, but cannot guarantee that a given assistive
    				technology provides the user with access to the element information
    				from that UIA tree. </p></ua-issue>
    			<ua-issue><p>The <prop>HelpText</prop> property is readable in the UIA framework
    				by any client that programs against the basic UIA property model, and
    				that property is forwarded/bridged to MSAA through the <function>get_accHelp</function> method.
    				However, as of 13 January 2011, no known assistive technology provides
    				users with a technique or interface option that accesses the <prop>HelpText</prop> / <function>get_accHelp</function> information. </p></ua-issue>

    		<description>
    			<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a long text alternative
    				that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the
    				original non-text content when a short text alternative is not sufficient,
    				and to show the practice of storing that information in a dedicated
    				property of the Silverlight-supported UI Automation support system.
    				The technique can also be used on text controls (such as <obj>TextBox</obj>),
    				for cases where the control text itself does not provide enough context
    				to suggest an appropriate user action. </p>
    			<p>The relevant UI Automation property is named <prop>HelpText</prop>,
    				to connote its possible usage to provide imperative instructions for
    				interactive elements. However, the same property can instead be used
    				for long text alternatives for nontext objects. The Silverlight API <prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop> directly
    				sets <prop>HelpText</prop> in the UI Automation tree. The properties
    				in the UI Automation tree are reported to assistive technologies, when
    				the assistive technology implements behavior that acts as a UI Automation
    				client. </p>
    			<p><prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop> can be set in code,
    				but is most typically set as an attribute in XAML that defines a Silverlight
    				UI. </p>
    			<p>The same information as is present in <prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop> could
    				also be useful to sighted users. In this case, the same text could
    				be displayed in a Silverlight <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.tooltip%28VS.95%29.aspx">ToolTip</loc> control.
    				The reason that application authors should use both <prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop> AND <obj>Tooltip</obj> in
    				conjunction is because the <obj>Tooltip</obj> information is
    				not introduced into the runtime accessibility framework information
    				set. This is because a tooltip is transient and not conventionally
    				focusable. In Silverlight programming, a useful technique for sharing
    				the same resource is to combine the Silverlight data binding feature
    				with the .NET Framework embedded resource feature. For more information
    				on combining Silverlight data binding and resources for common string
    				sources, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd882554%28VS.95%29.aspx">How

    		<description>
    			<p>The objective of this technique is to illustrate how in certain cases,
    				the Silverlight automation peer system can provide an accessibility
    				framework <prop>Name</prop> based on any simple text strings that
    				are also presented in the visible user interface as control content. </p>
    			<p>The applicability of this technique to SC 1.3.1 is that once promoted,
    				the <prop>Name</prop> becomes the primary information item that
    				describes the user interface element to accessibiity frameworks and
    				assistive technologies, and the information is thus immune to any further
    				applications of the Silverlight style system that might change the
    				appearance of the visual text equivalent (styled with color, uses italic
    				font for rendering basis, etc.) </p>
    			<p>The applicability of this technique to SC 4.1.2 is that the default
    				peer promotion behavior provides the Name component of Name, Role,
    				Value. This is related to the description of the term <emph>label</emph> in
    				SC4.1.2. </p>
    			<p>A default behavior for generating <prop>Name</prop> for accessibility
    				frameworks is possible for certain peers of content controls. The content
    				controls that might support a default automation peer behavior include: </p>
    			<ulist><item><p> <obj>TextBlock</obj> </p></item><item><p> <obj>ButtonBase</obj> derived classes that do not change
    				the <function>GetNameCore</function> implementation. This includes the <obj>Button</obj> class.
    				In order for the default promotion to work, the <prop>Content</prop> of
    				the button must be set as a plain string or must contain only a <obj>TextBlock</obj>;
    				any compositing such as wrapping in a <obj>Border</obj> or
    				other container will disable the default promotion. </p></item><item><p> Any other <obj>ContentControl</obj> derived class where
    					the <prop>Content</prop> property contains either <obj>TextBlock</obj> or
    					a text-content-only <obj>ButtonBase</obj> implementation as
    					sole content. </p></item></ulist>
    			<p>In these cases the string that sets either <prop>Content</prop> (for <obj>ContentControl</obj> and <obj>ButtonBase</obj>)
    				or <prop>Text</prop> (for <obj>TextBlock</obj>) is promoted
    				as the <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> for the control in
    				UI Automation, without any further attribution. The properties in the
    				UI Automation tree are reported to accessibility frameworks (UI Automation,
    				and MSAA through the bridge). The accessibility frameworks reports
    				this information to assistive technology clients. </p>
    			<p>Relying on default automation peer behavior is the preferred Silverlight
    				technique for supplying the accessibility framework "Name"   information,
    				so long as the default peer promotion actually does produce a usable
    				name. Using default behavior is preferred because re-using the strings
    				that are already used in the general visual presentation is less likely
    				to result in accessibility-specific strings being forgotten by the
    				application author, or get decoupled from visible UI in a revision
    				process. </p>
    			<p>For cases where there is control compositing in a control rather than
    				simple text, the automation peer typically cannot provide a default
    				simple string, and it may be the application author's responsibility
    				to set <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> explicitly as an
    				attribute in XAML, or as a property in runtime code. For details, see <specref ref="SL30"/>. </p>
    			<section id="SL20_test-based">
    				<head> Test-based methodology </head>
    				<p>In order to use this technique effectively, application authors are
    					expected to be following a test-based methodology towards verifying
    					what information their application is reporting to any pertinent accessibility
    					framework. Useful tools for this purpose include SilverlightSpy and
    					UIAVerify. Application authors might examine their running Silverlight
    					application on a test machine where the accessibility framework test
    					viewers are also active. Initially, the application author might view
    					the application at a point in the application development cycle that
    					is prior to any effort devoted to specifically adding accessibility-related
    					information to the application. Silverlight applications might be in
    					this state because the initial user interface design was done in a
    					visually oriented design tool such as Microsoft Expression Blend. Using
    					the test-based methodology, application authors might note that certain
    					accessibility framework properties are already populated, as a result
    					of the mechanisms that are described in this technique. However, it
    					is rare that ALL of the necessary accessibility information for an
    					application can be obtained entirely from the built-in default behaviors
    					of the automation peers. At this point, the application author may
    					have to apply additional Silverlight techniques that provide accessibility
    					framework information, for example <specref ref="SL30"/>. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to replace a timed Silverlight
    				animation with a non-timed user interface element that presents equivalent
    				information. This is useful in cases where the Silverlight animation
    				is a timed animation that may contain information that the user wants
    				to see without a time limit, such as crawling text in a text area.
    				The animated version of information in the user interface element can
    				instead be swapped out for an equivalent static element. </p>
    			<p>The Silverlight animation system is generalized such that nearly any
    				Silverlight property of type <obj>Double</obj>, <obj>Point</obj> or <obj>Color</obj> can
    				be animated, or a property can cycle through discrete object values.
    				Thus the possibilities for which properties in the user interface can
    				be animated are quite broad. The general technique shown can be used
    				to stop any animation. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to support or anticipate existing
    				browser zoom features effectively when users interact with the Silverlight
    				application. This technique explains how the Silverlight content area
    				reacts to the browser zoom feature implemented by some user agent hosts.
    				Silverlight content and layout properties are based on physical screen
    				pixel measurements. When the browser zoom is engaged, Silverlight content
    				scales correctly for the zoom factor, and uses the same zoom factor
    				as any surrounding HTML content. </p>
    			<p>Browser zoom is relevant for accessibility and Silverlight because
    				it is likely to be the zoom /scaling feature enabled by the browser
    				host that Web technology users are the most familiar with as a technique
    				for increasing the text size in Web content. </p>

    					and developers manually applied a <obj>ScaleTransform</obj> to Silverlight

    					to suppress some of the aliasing and distortion artifacts that host-level
    					scaling can introduce, particularly for video content or certain uses
    					of text. In these cases, application authors might consider other Silverlight
    					techniques for scaling the user interface, perhaps specifically only
    					for the text elements on a page. When an application disables the built-in
    					zoom behavior and rendering for Silverlight content, the browser still

    		<description>
    			<p>The objective of this technique is to define style switching logic
    				for Silverlight. In particular, the intent is to use the style switcher
    				to change the font size of text elements. This technique could be used
    				only for specific elements, or could also be applied to the entire
    				Silverlight content area and all text elements therein (including elements
    				such as <obj>TextBlock</obj> that are technically not controls).
    				Examples are provided for these two cases. </p>
    			<p>The property to style or otherwise change is the <prop>FontSize</prop> property.
    				Primarily, this is done using the API <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontsize%28VS.95%29.aspx">Control.FontSize</loc>,
    				but developers can also use similar properties on other objects that do not
    				derive from <obj>Control</obj> (examples: <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.textblock.fontsize%28VS.95%29.aspx">TextBlock</loc>; <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.datagridtextcolumn.fontsize%28VS.95%29.aspx">DataGridTextColumn</loc>). </p>
    			<p>Silverlight uses a style system whereby many properties that affect
    				UI appearance can be referred to and changed through a style resource.
    				The style resource overrides the default code implementation and the
    				default XAML template as provided by the Silverlight core implementation(or
    				a third party control author). A style enables an application author
    				to make a one-to-many change to property values in an efficient and
    				reversible way, and also to group multiple related property changes
    				as one unit of logic. Styles can be applied explicitly by referencing
    				them by name, or implicitly by associating a style with a class (which
    				then targets all instances of that class). This is analogous to how
    				CSS can either define styles globally for tags or uniquely for classids
    				and names. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight styles are always written in XAML. Silverlight event handlers
    				are most often written in code (there are related techniques that can
    				react to states with event associations, defined in pure XAML, but
    				the specific style switching technique is most straightforward in code). </p>
    			<section id="SL23_zoom-comparison">
    				<head> Using this technique versus relying on browser zoom </head>
    				<p>Silverlight supports browser zoom when viewed in browser hosts that
    					support a browser zoom feature. Specifically, Silverlight scales content
    					within its content area when the user engages browser zoom, based on
    					the browser zoom factor. However, not all browser hosts that Silverlight
    					supports have a browser zoom feature, and/or users might choose not
    					to use browser zoom. This technique presents an alternative technique
    					for font scaling in cases when relying on browser zoom is not viable
    					as a technique. Applications might use HTML DOM based logic to determine
    					the user agent string of the browser host, and use that as a determinant
    					of whether the user has browser zoom available as an option. If no
    					browser zoom feature exists for that user and their user agent, that
    					user could be served a version of the Silverlight application that
    					presents a UI and logic for sizing the fonts using the Silverlight
    					API, as described in this technique. </p>
    				<p>For more information about Silverlight and browser zoom, see the technique <specref ref="SL22"/>. </p>
    			</section>
    			<section id="SL23_percent">
    				<head> Sizing by percent </head>
    				<p>Generally, sizing Silverlight <prop>FontSize</prop> values by
    					percentages is not recommended. Sizing by percentage produces non-integer
    					font size values, which in turn produce aliasing artifacts. The Silverlight
    					rendering routines for text work best when dealing with integer numbers.
    					The entire Silverlight rendering system is based on pixel measurements.
    					In particular, the behavior for text rendering produces optimized font
    					shaping and subpixel rendering for text areas, and this behavior is
    					based on the assumption that font unit measurements will be provided
    					by applications using whole pixel values. </p>
    			</section>
    			<section id="SL23_units">
    				<head> Units for font sizing in Silverlight </head>
    				<p>Font sizing in Silverlight is always specified by a unit measure of
    					pixels. Other unit measures such as ems or points that come from a
    					migrated UI definition in XAML would need to be unit-converted to all
    					use a purely numeric value, such that attribute values in XAML do not
    					not include unit identifier suffixes such as "px", "pt", "em",
    					or "cm". This note is most relevant if the application author
    					is porting or migrating a Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) application
    					to Silverlight, or is using a XAML-emitting design tool that is producing
    					general XAML UI definitions and not targeting a specific framework. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use the <prop>AutoPlay</prop> property

    				playing its media source automatically. </p>
    			<p>By default the value of <prop>AutoPlay</prop> is true, which causes
    				any media that is the <prop>Source</prop> of the <obj>MediaElement</obj> to
    				play as soon as either the entire source file is loaded (for nonstreaming
    				media) or an initial buffer is loaded (for streaming media). To prevent
    				the possible accessibility issues, developers can instead specifically set <prop>AutoPlay</prop> to
    				false, so that the user always controls whether the media plays. This
    				technique would thus be used in combination with providing user interface
    				controls that go along with the <obj>MediaElement</obj>, and
    				that enable the user to control the media. In particular, the user
    				interface controls enable the media to play, pause or stop, with event
    				wiring for those controls associated with the <function>Play</function>, <function>Pause</function> or <function>Stop</function> methods
    				of the <obj>MediaElement</obj> object. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use the combination of Silverlight
    				control activation and programmatic focus to enable the user to skip
    				regions of content in a Silverlight application user interface. </p>
    			<p>The control that the user activates should clearly indicate that its
    				purpose is to skip content, so that the resulting programmatic focus
    				shift is not interpreted as an undesired change of context. </p>
    			<p>The object to call focus to (the receiver of focus after the user-initiated
    				action is triggered) has to be a <obj>Control</obj> in the Silverlight
    				programming model. This is because the <function>Focus</function> method
    				must be called on the target, and therefore the target must inherit
    				the <obj>Control</obj> class. So, an application author might
    				call focus to a read-only <obj>TextBox</obj>, or perhaps a <obj>RichTextBox</obj>,
    				depending on the purpose of the Silverlight application and its user
    				interface design. You can also focus a <obj>UserControl</obj>,
    				for cases where the area to call focus to represents a custom control
    				implementation. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use the <prop>AutomationProperties.LabeledBy</prop> property
    				to associate a non-interactive text label with an interactive field
    				such as a Silverlight <obj>TextBox</obj> or <obj>RichTextBox</obj>.
    				By using this technique, application authors can use the label text
    				as the default source for <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> on

    			<p>This technique relies on several Silverlight features: the <prop>Name</prop> property
    				for identifying specific UI elements, the <obj>AutomationProperties</obj> API,
    				and the ElementName variation of Silverlight data binding. <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> can
    				be set on and can target any Silverlight <obj>UIElement</obj>.

    			<ua-issue><p>Most assistive technologies will use the HTML Lang tag value as the
    				determinant of the language of the page. Assistive technologies would
    				also use HTML Lang tag values for the language of parts. HTML Lang
    				is not specifically reported in accessibility frameworks, so assistive
    				technologies would typically be accessing the HTML DOM to get this
    				information. </p></ua-issue>
    			<ua-issue><p>Existing behavior on screen readers is not able to determine language
    				programmatically by using the CultureInfo and Language properties of
    				.NET and Silverlight that are referenced in the body of this technique.
    				For an alternative technique that specifically uses HTML Lang on two
    				discrete Silverlight object tags, such that language of parts can be
    				determined through the same principles as described in <loc href="H58" linktype="techniques">H58</loc>,
    				see <specref ref="SL4"/>. </p></ua-issue>
    			<ua-issue><p>In the case of the parts that are within Silverlight, these parts
    				are not HTML parts and thus do not provide the ability to specify HTML
    				Lang. For this reason, Silverlight application authors should be cautious
    				about defining extensive text regions in Silverlight that set a Silverlight <prop>Language</prop> to
    				be other than that declared by the hosting page HTML Lang. Any such
    				text regions might not be processed correctly by an assistive technology
    				such as a screen reader. In particular, authors should not specify
    				HTML Lang at all if it is uncertain that the language of the Silverlight "part" will
    				match, due to the "CurrentCulture" that is determined only
    				at run time on the client. In these cases it is best to leave HTML
    				Lang unspecified, so that language properties are under the control
    				of the user's browser settings/preferences, or operating system settings/preferences. </p></ua-issue>
    		</ua-issues>
    		<description>
    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use the combination of HTML
    				<att>Lang</att> attribute, <obj>CultureInfo</obj> and <prop>Language</prop> to
    				correctly specify the language of the entirety of Silverlight content,
    				or of parts within the Silverlight content. </p>
    			<p>In general, Silverlight does not attempt to repurpose HTML Lang, because
    				Silverlight is not HTML. Instead, internally within the Silverlight
    				content area, Silverlight uses language definition concepts that relate
    				to XML (<prop>Language</prop> is a remapping of xml:lang) or .NET
    				Framework programming (<obj>CultureInfo</obj>). For these reasons,
    				HTML Lang techniques as described in [<loc href="H58" linktype="techniques">H58</loc>]
    				are not useful for Silverlight programming of Silverlight-specific "parts". </p>
    			<p>What becomes important in Silverlight application programming then
    				is to make sure that the HTML language concept of Lang and the Silverlight
    				language concept of CultureInfo or Lang are not at odds with one another,
    				or reporting misinformation. In particular, application authors should
    				avoid situations where an assistive technology has HTML Lang available
    				for programmatic determination of either page or part, but the effective
    				runtime language in the Silverlight part is different. The result here
    				might be that a screen reader that changes functionality such as phonetic
    				pronunciations would not correctly read the text content from the Silverlight
    				content. Avoiding this situation is largely a matter of due diligence
    				on the part of a Silverlight application author, OR on the part of
    				the Web page author who authors surrounding HTML, in cases where a
    				Web page is embedding Silverlight content or packages that the Web
    				page's author did not actively develop and is only consuming/embedding. </p>
    			<p>The following is a general recommendation that summarizes the detailed
    				discussion in subsequent subheadings: </p>
    			<ulist><item><p> If the Silverlight application does not have a strong emphasis
    				on presenting textual information with a particular language association,
    				HTML Lang should be left blank. This causes assistive technologies
    				to defer to either user agent or platform language settings. Silverlight
    				is able to determine these same language values at run time, and
    				language behavior of assistive technologies and of Silverlight is
    				kept synchronized through the use of the same external information
    				set. </p></item><item><p> If the Silverlight application DOES have a strong emphasis on
    					presenting textual information with A SINGLE particular language
    					association, HTML Lang should be assigned to report that specific
    					language either for whole page or at least for the Silverlight object
    					tag. This enables assistive technologies to pick up the value, per <loc href="H57" linktype="techniques">H57:
    						Using language attributes on the html element HTML</loc>. Aside from
    					due diligence during development and deployment, Silverlight application
    					code might choose to enforce that its runtime CultureInfo is really
    					the same. This could be addressed with a specific HTML DOM helper
    					function. </p></item><item><p> If the Silverlight application has MULTIPLE language associations,
    						the best option is to separate the Silverlight application into object
    						parts at the HTML level, to assure that HTML Lang and intended runtime
    						language do not clash. This is particularly important if the application
    						is actively resetting CurrentCulture away from the user settings
    						of platform or user agent. For more information, see <specref ref="SL4"/>. </p></item></ulist>

    						Using language attributes on the html element HTML</loc>. By using the
    					same language values with both techniques as a better practice, H57
    					will satisfy 3.1.1 while setting the language value of the Silverlight
    					content to match will assist authors in meeting SC 3.1.2. </p>
    				<p>The Silverlight runtime itself does not attempt to inherit language
    					settings that come from markup that is outside the Silverlight-specific
    					content. In particular, the HTML <att>Lang</att> attribute applied to the html
    					tag, Lang on host object tag, specific parameters of the Silverlight
    					object tag, all have no affect on the value of any Silverlight <prop>Language</prop> attribute.
    					Instead, the Silverlight <prop>Language</prop> defaults to the <obj>CultureInfo</obj> of
    					the Silverlight runtime as instantiated by HTML object tag invocation.
    					It is expected that if a Silverlight application contains extensive
    					text where language of text is a factor for assistive technology purposes,
    					developers will manually set the HTML Lang tag to match the <prop>Language</prop> value
    					on the Silverlight root element in XAML. Development tools might or
    					might not enforce or inform the relationship between HTML Lang and
    					Silverlight <prop>Language</prop>; that consideration is outside
    					the scope of Silverlight as a technology. If language is not a major
    					factor in the application, application authors should consider leaving
    					HTML Lang blank on the hosting HTML page. </p>
    				<p>You can programatically determine the value of HTML Lang of surrounding
    					HTML from within the Silverlight API, by using the DOM-bridging method <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.browser.htmlelement.getattribute%28VS.95%29.aspx">HtmlElement.GetAttribute</loc>.
    					Otherwise, this can be determined by techniques other than Silverlight's
    					(such as scripting to the HTML DOM of the hosting browser). </p>

    				<p><prop>Language</prop> is an attribute that is available on all
    					Silverlight objects that directly represent a UI element. Language
    					can be queried (or set) by Silverlight managed code run time, such
    					that the <prop>Language</prop> value can be programatically determined
    					within the Silverlight programming model. </p>
    				<p>The format of the value that is used to set <prop>Language</prop> is
    					based on ISO-639-1, and is thus compatible with <loc href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt</loc>. </p>
    				<p><prop>Language</prop> has a behavior that parallels the behavior
    					of <att>xml:lang</att> in an XML document: if <prop>Language</prop> is set on
    					a parent element, all child elements inherit that <prop>Language</prop> value.
    					An actual <att>xml:lang</att> attribute in XAML is also valid for this purpose. </p>
    				<p><prop>Language</prop> can be set at the root of a XAML document,
    					so that the entire UI shares the same language setting. If <prop>Language</prop> is
    					not explicitly set at the root by application markup, <prop>Language</prop> is
    					inferred per running instance, based on processing the acting <obj>CultureInfo</obj> at
    					run time. </p>
    				<p>However, another usage is for application authors to set <prop>Language</prop> on
    					a specific child element, to override the root-level or client-environment-inferred <prop>Language</prop> value.
    					This enables consciously embedding a content part that is deliberately
    					in a different language than the remainder of the Silverlight content. </p>
    				<p>Exactly what happens when a <prop>Language</prop> is set on a
    					part is not always specified, and is largely a matter of implementation
    					detail of the individual Silverlight classes that might be a "part".
    					However, as an informative generalization, the value of <prop>Language</prop> might
    					affect considerations such as: how white space is processed (in particular
    					CR or LF); character sets for fonts; string formatting when using APIs
    					specifically on that part. </p>

    				<head> CultureInfo </head>
    				<p><obj>CultureInfo</obj> is a concept that is relevant to .NET
    					Framework programming. This concept applies to Silverlight because
    					Silverlight uses a specific implementation of a CLR runtime that uses
    					.NET Framework principles. <obj>CultureInfo</obj> potentially
    					specifies both a language and a culture. This distinction becomes relevant
    					for advanced string formatting concepts that are provided in the .NET
    					Framework, such as decimal separators, dates, and currency. For example,
    					an application author might simply specify "en" if the author
    					did not care about string formatting, but might specify "en-GB" if
    					the application was using string formatting for currency values with
    					the intention of displaying Pounds Sterling as currency unit in string
    					formatting. </p>
    				<p>Silverlight applications often run using an inferred <obj>CultureInfo</obj> based
    					on the operating system where the user agent browser host exists (in
    					other words, the culture of the client computer where the Silverlight
    					application is run). This <obj>CultureInfo</obj> can be queried
    					by applications at run time; see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture%28VS.95%29.aspx">CultureInfo.CurrentCulture</loc>.
    					Application authors can deliberately constrain the set of <obj>CultureInfo</obj> cases
    					that a Silverlight application can be run under, in order to verify
    					that necessary string resources for that culture are available in that
    					application. This is done by setting &lt;SupportedCultures&gt; in the
    					Silverlight project settings. If a user accesses the application on
    					a client that is outside the SupportedCultures, the application author
    					has the following choices: </p>
    				<ulist><item><p> Use a fallback resource set representing a neutral culture; this
    					is enabled automatically by the Silverlight resources lookup behavior,
    					so long as the project includes resources identified as being culture-neutral.
    					This is the preferred approach. </p></item><item><p> Use client logic to detect the culture, and initiate a client-side
    						redirect to request either a different XAP or a different hosting
    						HTML page. </p></item><item><p> Trap requests at the server level by checking lang request in
    							the header. This varies between server implementations, is not a

    				<p><obj>CultureInfo</obj> generally applies to the Silverlight
    					application as a whole. There are advanced techniques whereby worker
    					threads can be run as separate cultures, but that is not discussed
    					here and is not relevant because only the main UI thread has relevance
    					to Web content accessibility. So, if an application author wants to

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use text captioning that comes
    				from a separate text file, synchronize the captions with the media
    				in a Silverlight <obj>MediaElement</obj>, and display the captions
    				in Silverlight. </p>
    			<p>There are two variations of the general theme of implementing Silverlight
    				media player controls to work with external timed text: using built-in
    				capabilities of the Microsoft Expression Encoder tool, and using parsing
    				code that consumes caption as a raw file format and converts that format
    				into the Silverlight API's <obj>TimelineMarkers</obj> representation.
    				This technique primarily addresses how to use the Expression Encoder
    				technique, along with media player templates that are also provided
    				by Expression Encoder or related Silverlight SDKs such as the Smooth
    				Streaming SDK. </p>
    			<p>At a pure architecture level, Silverlight uses the <obj>TimelineMarkers</obj> API
    				to display caption text at synchronized times. The Expression Encoder
    				and Expression Blend tools provide a front end to drive the <obj>TimelineMarkers</obj> API
    				for the supported formats. The intention of the architecture is so
    				that Silverlight as a run-time has a base architecture that could potentially
    				use any existing or future timed text format, but the tools for Silverlight
    				(rather than built-in features of the runtime) provide the optimized
    				workflow for producing captioned media projects. </p>
    			<p>A procedure for using the Expression Encoder and Expression Blend
    				tools to produce a Silverlight media player application that can consume
    				timed text in TTML format is provided as Example 1 in this technique.
    				(Note: prior to the approval of TTML by W3C, DFXP was a format that
    				used much of the eventual TTML vocabulary. In tools that predate TTML,
    				this format is often identified as DFXP.) </p>
    			<p>A purely code-based parsing technique, with the goal of avoiding Expression
    				Encoder dependencies, is necessarily more complex. This is because
    				there are multiple issues to solve: </p>
    			<ulist><item><p> Obtaining and validating the timed text file </p></item><item><p> Parsing the format into general information items like timings,
    				text, format etc. that are either consumable directly in a Silverlight
    				API, or useful as intermediates </p></item><item><p> Using the timecode information to create <obj>TimelineMarker</obj> representations
    					for each timed text entity </p></item><item><p> Associating the <obj>TimelineMarkers</obj> with media loaded
    						by the player </p></item><item><p> Finding a place to store the additional formatting that is conveyed,
    							including the text and any formatting </p></item><item><p> Handling events from <obj>TimelineMarkers</obj> in the media
    								player, in such a way that text and formatting behavior can be retrieved
    								and presented in the Text part of the player UI </p></item></ulist>

    				<head> Text Captioning Formats </head>
    				<p>There are several existing text-based formats that are used for text
    					captioning of prerecorded media. The following are supported as formats

    				<head>Using Expression Encoder and Expression Blend to produce
    					a Silverlight media player project from tool output and templates</head>
    				<description>
    					<p>By far the simplest technique for incorporating existing timed-text
    						information is to use Microsoft Expression Encoder and the media player
    						templates that an Expression Encoder project produces by default. You
    						can use timed text in any of the following formats: DFXP, SAMI, SRT,
    						SUB, and LRC. Associating a caption file with a media source is done
    						as an "import" operation in the Expression Encoder tool.
    						However, the   "import" does not necessarily mean that the
    						timed text file is integrated into the media stream; Silverlight authors have the option
    						to preserve the file separation. This is useful if the application is obtaining
    						timed text from a third party source in real-time, or if Silverlight authors have a
    						production pipeline that makes it difficult to have the captioning
    						ready in time to be encoded in the stream along with the audio-visual
    						source files. For third-party timed text files that are served directly
    						from the third party's HTTP servers, it can be useful to supply a dummy
    						URL in the initial project encoding. The output of the Expression Encoder
    						project parameterizes many of the project settings at the HTML level.
    						This makes it possible to change the URL at any time prior to deployment
    						without having to rebuild the project. The following code is the HTML
    						output of a sample Expression Encoder project. Note the CaptionSources
    						node in the initparams; that is the information item that informs the
    						Expression Encoder templates where to find the timed text file. </p>

    				<description>
    					<p>This example defines a very simple media player class that includes
    						a display surface, basic controls, and a text display for captions
    						as part of its default template. The usage code for this control in
    						XAML is simple, but only because the majority of the implementation
    						is present in the definition of the media player class. </p>
    					<p>
    					The following is example usage XAML: </p>
    					<codeblock><![CDATA[ <local:SimpleMediaPlayerWithTT Width="480" Height="360" CaptionUri="testttml.xml" MediaSourceUri="/xbox.wmv" />
    					]]></codeblock>
    					<p>Note the attributes CaptionUri and SimpleMediaPlayerWithTT. Each
    						of these is a custom property of the media control class TTReader.
    						CaptionUri in particular references a URL, in this case a local URL
    						from the same server that serves the Silverlight XAP. The timed text
    						file could come from a different server also, but comes from a local
    						server in this example to conform to the behavior of the test file. </p>
    					<p>The following is the generic.xaml default template for the media player
    						control. The template is mainly relevant for showing the named elements
    						that are shown in the initialization code. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use some of the basic user interface
    				objects in Silveright to produce blocks of content that are identified
    				as a "List" to accessibility frameworks and to Silverlight's
    				own tab sequence navigation behavior. </p>
    			<p>Using the "List" technique results in a tab sequence behavior
    				whereby that element is treated as a single tab stop, even if that
    				element has consituent elements (the list items) that would otherwise
    				be considered additional tab stops in the main tab sequence. In the
    				default key handling, when the user presses the TAB key while focus
    				is on a List, the focus goes to the next element after the List. To
    				focus the items of the list, the user would press the Arrow keys rather
    				than TAB. In the Silverlight programming model for controls, this tab
    				sequence behavior is expressed by the <prop>TabNavigation</prop> property
    				holding the value of <prop>Once</prop>. The Silverlight <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</loc> is
    				a control that reports itself as "List" role, and that has
    				a default <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.tabnavigation%28VS.95%29.aspx">TabNavigation.Once</loc> value.
    				Thus <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</loc> as
    				per this technique is a lightweight technique for producing blocks
    				that can be bypassed. It is specifically a lightweight technique because
    				it can be accomplished by writing simple application-level XAML and
    				using only the Silverlight core libraries. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight also supports more full-featured techniques for producing
    				bypass blocks that are based on common user interface features such
    				as menus or toolbars. However, using toolbars in Silverlight is inherently
    				not as lightweight because the Silverlight core libraries themselves
    				do not include a ready-made toolbar. Silverlight provides a <obj>ContextMenu</obj> as
    				part of the Silverlight Toolkit extensions, but the behavior of this
    				particular menu does not easily address the bypass block scenario.
    				Silverlight includes all the infrastructure and necessary base classes
    				for defining a toolbar or a menu that could address the bypass block
    				scenario. Many third-party control implementations of menus and toolbars
    				exist, either as part of control packages that are sold by control
    				vendors, or through community mechanisms such as CodePlex or third-party
    				sites that provide free source code. For some examples, see the following: </p>
    			<ulist><item><p> <loc href="http://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/">http://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/</loc> </p></item><item><p> <loc href="http://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/StudioSilverlight/">http://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/StudioSilverlight/</loc> </p></item><item><p> <loc href="http://www.vectorlight.net/silverlight/controls.aspx">http://www.vectorlight.net/silverlight/controls.aspx</loc> </p></item></ulist>
    			<p>If application authors use a built-in control such as <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</loc> where
    				the accessibility framework reported role is not traditionally associated
    				with a navigation role, it is a best practice to set <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> such
    				that the name informs the user of the purpose of the list control.
    				Otherwise, the role alone leaves this ambiguous. For example, an author
    				might name the list control "Navigation control". </p>
    			<p>Often the List control itself is focusable. So long as the List control
    				has a visual focus indicator, that behavior might be acceptable. However,
    				it might provide a better user experience to deliberately have the
    				List itself non-focusable, and instead have focus fall to the first
    				List item when focus reaches that region. Otherwise, the List might
    				be perceived as an "extra" tab stop to some users. To enable
    				that behavior, set <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.istabstop%28VS.95%29.aspx">IsTabStop</loc> to
    				false on the List control. The List itself still provides the intended
    				tab navigation behavior, and is still reported and identified to accessibility
    				frameworks and assistive technologies, even when the List container
    				is not focusable. This is shown in Example 1, by setting <prop>IsTabStop</prop> as
    				part of a <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.style%28VS.95%29.aspx">Style</loc>. </p>
    			<p>When an accessibility framework presents a List, assistive technologies
    				are generally expected to continue to support use of the same key behavior
    				as the default behavior, and to report to users that the item is a
    				List when it is focused. If assistive technologies use the accessibility
    				framework APIs for navigation, the items in the list are considered
    				child elements. Navigating either by spatial direction (e.g. NAVDIR_RIGHT
    				in MSAA) or sequential direction (e.g. NAVDIR_NEXT in MSAA) skips the
    				list items and goes to the spatial/next peer. </p>

    				<head>Customize the behavior and appearance of a ListBox to
    					construct a navigation control that can be bypassed</head>
    				<description>
    					<p>In this example, several properties that influence the items presentation
    						behavior of the Silverlight core control <obj>ListBox</obj> are
    						adjusted to make it suitable for a navigation control. The behavior
    						of this control is that when the tab sequence reaches the control,   "next" or
    						spatial navigation continues on to other controls, rather than through
    						the child controls of the list's items/options. This is enabled and
    						properly reported because <obj>ListBox</obj> reports its accessibility
    						framework role as "List", uses <prop>TabNavigation</prop> = Once as
    						default (because it is the default, <prop>TabNavigation</prop> does not have to
    						be set explicitly in the markup). <obj>ListBox</obj> has default
    						key handling for the arrow keys (to enable traversing the choices in
    						the menu by keyboard-only). The control could also be visually a menu
    						or perhaps other user interface control metaphors, depending on how
    						it is visually templated and composited. Regardless of appearance,
    						the accessibility framework and any assistive technologies based on
    						that framework will treat the control as a "List". This example
    						is templated as a horizontally oriented toolbar-type control. The items
    						in this example are <obj>Button</obj> controls, but could be
    						templated to not appear quite as button-like, or could instead use
    						another focusable control for the items such as a read-only <obj>TextBox</obj>. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to properly apply Silverlight control
    				composition techniques that can present text and non-text in UI as
    				part of the same control. This technique explains the consequences
    				that using control composition has on how that control is reported
    				to the accessibility frameworks that Silverlight supports. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight control composition concepts are relevant either to Silverlight
    				developers who define and package a Silverlight control for use by
    				other Silverlight authors, or for Silverlight application authors that
    				use Silverlight controls in their UI but use the content properties
    				of such controls to include several other elements in a composite layout. </p>
    			<p>In Silverlight programming and UI definition, Silverlight authors can use control
    				composition to define a parent control that initiates an action. The
    				control can have component parts, such as text and non-text composition
    				pieces that display within the control and have equivalent meaning.
    				Silverlight authors can rely on the text component of the control to
    				provide any text alternative for purposes other than the accessibility
    				framework. However, Silverlight authors should declare alternative
    				text on the control that is specifically consumed by accessibility
    				frameworks, by setting <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> as
    				an attribute in XAML. In most cases, this text can be the same as the
    				visible text in the control composition, per the definition of 'label'
    				in SC 4.1.2. </p>
    			<p>Note that this technique does not result in a duplication of text,
    				as explained in <loc href="H2" linktype="techniques">H2</loc>.
    				This is because the element parts of control composition are either
    				inherently not focusable separately, or can be specified by instance-specific
    				properties to behave as if they cannot be focused. The parts in Silverlight
    				composition are not promoted to the accessibility frameworks as parts
    				of an application-specific UI Automation tree, so that control composition
    				as an implementation detail does not interfere with the usage of controls
    				by Silverlight application authors. The primary source of accessibility-related
    				information is the specific <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> property
    				as set on the parent control in the composition, which is set by the
    				application author rather than the control author. </p>
    			<p>The control author does specify the information that is reported to
    				accessibility frameworks as the "ClassName", which is often
    				used by assistive technologies for identification purposes and is appended
    				to any "Name" value. For example, if an application author
    				includes a   "Widget" control, and gives it an <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> value
    				of "Show Map", an assistive technology might identify the
    				element as   "Show Map widget". The "Show Map" part
    				comes from the application author code, and the "widget" part
    				comes from the Widget control implementation code. </p>

    				<description>
    					<p>In this example the <obj>TextBlock</obj> that goes with the
    						graphic image conveys the text information for non-accessibility purposes.
    						The <obj>Button</obj> has internal composition that combines
    						text from a non-focusable <obj>TextBlock</obj> part and an image
    						part. Therefore the "Pause" Text is not promoted to serve
    						as "Name" through built-in <obj>Button</obj> automation
    						peer logic. The Silverlight application author is responsible for explicitly
    						setting <prop>AutomationProperties.Name</prop> on the <obj>Button</obj> so
    						that the text equivalent is available to the accessibility framework.
    						This example shows the XAML UI. The logic, which might be attached

    						not shown. </p>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to change the presentation / visual
    				appearance of text, by setting several of the font-specific properties
    				in the Silverlight API. Changing such properties does not change the
    				semantic meaning of the text, nor does it alter the representation
    				of the text that is available to assistive technologies through the
    				Silverlight support of the UIA accessibility framework. By using font
    				properties, it is possible to introduce a wide variety of presentation
    				changes to fonts that do not introduce semantic elements that interfere
    				with an assistive technology's view of text in the Silverlight application.
    				In particular, adjusting font properties will make it possible to avoid
    				any need for use of images of text, yet still provide a wide range
    				of choices for text presentation. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight font properties exist on all controls, as well as on other
    				text elements that are not true controls. For controls, the font properties
    				apply in any case where the control enables a presentation mode that
    				has enclosed text areas in its layout. By setting Silverlight font
    				properties, it is possible to adjust presentation of font features
    				without changing the structural connotation of that control, or the
    				value of any control-specific property that contains plain-text. For
    				example, the <prop>FontSize</prop> property can be set on a <obj>Paragraph</obj> (not
    				a control) or on a <obj>Button</obj> (a control, and in this
    				case the font size changes apply to any text displayed in the button
    				content area). Font properties are also inheriting properties, meaning
    				that if applying a font property value to a container in a relationship,
    				those font property values can apply to child elements in the relationship.
    				For example, if a <prop>FontSize</prop> is applied to a <obj>RichTextBox</obj>,
    				that <prop>FontSize</prop> value is used by default by all the <obj>Paragraph</obj> items
    				displayed in the <obj>RichTextBox</obj>. </p>
    			<p>Similar to CSS, Silverlight font properties can be grouped as a <obj>Style</obj>.
    				That <obj>Style</obj> can be applied to all instances of a text
    				element type (for example to all cases of <obj>Paragraph</obj>)
    				or specifically referenced as a resource that is only used by certain
    				instances of a text element type. Either way, the <obj>Style</obj> feature
    				enables the separation of presentation from semantics for text elements,
    				and enables workflows where content authors supply the semantic text
    				and design-oriented authors adjust the related Silverlight styles.
    				For more information on the Silverlight concept of styles, see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278068%28VS.95%29.aspx">Control
    					Customization on MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			<p>The following Silverlight font properties are useful to style text
    				and avoid the need for text in images. Links in this list refer to
    				the <obj>Control</obj> class version of these properties. </p>
    			<ulist><item><p> The <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontfamily%28VS.95%29.aspx">FontFamily</loc> property
    				is used to display the code aspect in a monospace font family (specifically,
    				FontFamily="Courier New"). </p></item>
    			<item><p> The <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontsize%28VS.95%29.aspx">FontSize</loc> property

    			<item><p> The <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontstyle%28VS.95%29.aspx">FontStyle</loc> property
    				is used to display text in italics. </p></item>
    				<item><p> The <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsembedded//ee502142">FontWeight</loc> property
    				is used to set how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed. </p></item>
    				<item><p> The <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontstretch.aspx">FontStretch</loc> property
    				is used to control the spacing of letters in text. </p></item>
    			<item><p> The <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.foreground%28VS.95%29.aspx">Foreground</loc> property
    				is used to display the color of text or text containers. </p></item>
    			<item><p> The <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.background%28VS.95%29.aspx">Background</loc> property
    			can be used to display text on a non-text background. </p></item>
    			</ulist>
    			<p>So long as images of text are avoided, the text within a Silverlight
    				text element can be reported to the UI Automation accessibility framework
    				that Silverlight supports. That text is reported using the same basic
    				text content as is used for semantic text display in the UI. In other
    				words, exposing that text to assistive technologies that use UIA as
    				a framework does not require the Silverlight application author to
    				resort to automation-specific override properties such as <prop>AutomationProperties.HelpText</prop>;
    				the automation peers for text elements report all necessary text content
    				to automation as a built-in behavior of the text element controls.
    				For more information on UI Automation and text containers, see <specref ref="SL32"/>. </p>

it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before 
coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my

get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into 
the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. 
This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself 
upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, 
almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to choose a Silverlight text container
    				that provides appropriate behavior and accessibility roles for different
    				types of text content. How those roles interact with existing assistive
    				technologies that are interpreting Silverlight under the larger concept
    				of being an "HTML control part" is also a factor in which
    				Silverlight text container should be used in an application's composition. </p>
    			<p>Text containers can identified by role to accessibility frameworks,
    				and each type of Silverlight text container uses a different role.
    				Application authors should choose text containers that combine the
    				desired behavior in the user interface with an accessibility role that
    				can be consumed by existing assistive technology implementations. </p>
    			<p>The Silverlight core libraries define the following classes that are
    				specifically intended as text containers: </p>

    				<head> UI Automation programmatic access </head>
    				<p>For programming information that is relevant for how Silverlight application
    					authors produce the application, each text container has its own object
    					model/API. That API is documented on MSDN, specifically for each class <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.textbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">TextBox</loc>; <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.richtextbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">RichTextBox</loc>; <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.textblock%28VS.95%29.aspx">TextBlock</loc>.)
    					However, rather than using the Silverlight-specific object models,
    					most assistive technologies that are capable of reporting on Silverlight
    					will choose to use UI Automation (or MSAA) to obtain information about
    					the Silverlight elements in general. Text containers within the Silverlight
    					content are identified through UIA accessibility roles. This is because
    					the assistive technologies can use UI Automation to query for ANY relevant
    					text items from the content (and chrome) of the user agent / browser
    					host, not just those that come from Silverlight. That can include the
    					HTML content, items created from scripting, CSS or other plugin-internal
    					object models and so on. In other words, text from Silverlight is integrated
    					into the overall UI Automation view of the user agent host as the top-level
    					application in a platform view. Different types of "text" in
    					a general sense might appear as different UI Automation patterns, as
    					is described below. </p>

    				<p>In typical user interface design, a form with an input field also

    					in Silverlight programming to set the <obj>RichTextBox</obj> to

    				<p>The Text pattern provides APIs to iterate over the internal structure

    					APIs. .NET Framework or Windows Automation APIs are generally what
    					is used for programming a UI Automation client, which runs on a platform
    					runtime rather than the Silverlight runtime. Using the Text pattern

    						in the Silverlight object model (it is not a class derived from <obj>Control</obj>).
    						The practical implications of this to accessibility scenarios is
    						that a <obj>TextBlock</obj> is not in the default tab sequence,
    						cannot be manually added to any tab sequence, and cannot be keyboard-focused

    					readers can interact with the Silverlight content. Screen readers typically
    					read text only from the currently focused element in cases where the

    					application, and thus cannot read the text from a <obj>TextBlock</obj> in
    					such a mode. However, most screen readers also have modes for reading
    					text that is not necessarily focusable. These are generally the same
    					modes that screen readers use for a conventional non-interactive HTML
    					document text. For example, some screen readers support a mode that
    					reads text by line, or by word. These modes can read text from a <obj>TextBlock</obj>. </p>

    				<head>Structure from a container that has non-semantic role
    					in UI Automation, and TextBlock for text</head>
    				<description>
    					<p>If viewed as a UI Automation tree, the <obj>StackPanel</obj> and <obj>Grid</obj> do
    						not exist explicitly in the tree view, because they do not serve a
    						semantic role (only a presentation role). Rather, the tree consists
    						of the items that report some kind of semantic control type. The semantic
    						children of the containers are still reported in the order that they
    						were declared, when viewed as children of the next semantic container
    						upwards in the tree, and despite the containers themselves being abstracted
    						out of the tree. This defines the reading order. This example is a
    						large block of text with intentionally simple formatting, where the
    						only formatting is to represent paragraphs as separate <obj>TextBlock</obj> elements
    						to support an adaptive layout, but no <obj>Run</obj> blocks within. </p>
    					<p>When viewed with assistive technologies that represent the contents,
    						each <obj>TextBlock</obj> is a control type of Text. Screen readers
    						can use document reading modes such as virtual cursor modes to read
    						the content from each element and each element's content, following
    						the same reading order as is declared in the XAML. For example, in
    						JAWS 12, readers can read out this text container line by line using
    						(Jaws Key)+DownArrow. It is actually JAWS that determines the line
    						length, because the line length otherwise is defined only by the adaptive
    						layout at runtime, which is not reported to UIA. </p>

reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; 
some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; 
some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use the characteristics of the
    				XAML language to support basic parsing requirements that both applications
    				and accessibility frameworks rely upon. This technique explains the
    				role of XAML in the overall Silverlight development and application
    				architecture, in particular for defining the elements that make up
    				a Silverlight user interface. This technique also present some basic
    				facts about XAML as a language; more information of this nature is
    				also included in <specref ref="silverlight_notes"/>. </p>
    			<p>XAML is a markup language for object instantiation. XAML can be incorporated
    				into a technology such as Silverlight. A specific XAML vocabulary can
    				be defined by a technology such as Silverlight, and the vocabulary
    				can be extended by anyone that provides suitable backing code. For
    				example, a Silverlight application author can define a custom class,
    				and the application author or potentially other Silverlight application
    				authors can use XAML to instantiate instances of the custom class. </p>
    			<p>XAML has a <loc href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114525">published
    				language specification</loc>. </p>
    			<p>XAML does not necessarily declare the entirety of the object tree
    				that a Silverlight client runtime loads, but XAML typically declares
    				the majority of the objects/elements that represent the Silverlight
    				application's user interface. The objects and values that are used
    				for accessibility scenarios are often closely related to the standard
    				user interface, and thus accessibility-related properties are typically
    				declared in XAML rather than in code, even though setting the values
    				in code is technically possible. </p>

    			<section id="SL33_xaml-xml">
    				<head> XAML and XML </head>
    				<p>XAML is based on XML, and shares many of its language features. Some
    					of the language features that are directly relevant to the stated intent
    					of SC4.1.1 and to 4.1.1 related techniques include: </p>
    				<ulist><item><p> Well-formedness: The definition of well-formed XAML is the same
    					as the XML definition. XAML processors, including the Silverlight
    					runtime XAML parser, will block loading XAML that is not well formed. </p></item><item><p> Duplicate attributes: Unless specially configured for scenarios
    						such as design-time support, XAML processors will block loading XAML
    						where elements contain duplicate attributes. </p></item><item><p> Quote matching: mismatched quote matching for attribute values
    							in XAML constitutes XAML that is not well formed. </p></item></ulist>
    				<p>Some XAML language features that are analogous to XML but have some
    					technology-specific differences include: </p>
    				<ulist><item><p> Identifiers: XAML defines a <prop>Name</prop> directive, which
    					is analogous to <att>xml:id</att> in that <prop>Name</prop> serves
    					as the unique identifier of an element. However, XAML defines an
    					additional concept of a XAML namescope, which permits a XAML document
    					to contain multiple XAML namescopes as a factoring technique. Thus,
    					identical <prop>Name</prop> values are permitted in a XAML document
    					so long as each is defined in a separate XAML namescope. XAML namescopes
    					are associated with elements, such that the extent of each XAML namescope
    					is understood by XAML processors. </p></item><item><p> Schemas and vocabularies: A notable difference between XAML and
    						XML is that a XAML vocabulary is not typically represented in existing
    						XML schema definition formats such as XSD or DTD. XAML includes inheritance
    						and reference features that cannot adequately be expressed in XSD
    						or other existing XML schema representation formats. This affects
    						the "elements are nested according to their specifications"   consideration
    						of SC4.1.1. XAML definitely has the ability to enforce nesting restrictions
    						as represented by a XAML vocabulary. However, XAML validity for a
    						vocabulary is deliberately fluid, in order to support extension by
    						user code. XAML validity is determined by a combination of a XAML
    						processor, a XAML concept known as a XAML schema context, and the
    						code that backs the XAML and defines any objects being instantiated
    						as a parsing result. Typically, design time tools such as Microsoft
    						Visual Studio can adequately duplicate the runtime validity characteristics
    						of a XAML vocabulary. Using these tools, application authors can
    						both verify XAML validity as well as receive design-time information
    						for how to correct any XAML validity errors. </p></item></ulist>

    					as resources in a library. Thus Silverlight XAML is human readable
    					as well as machine readable. </p>
    				<p>However, unlike HTML, Silverlight XAML is only intended to be loaded
    					and interpreted by the Silverlight runtime, rather than multiple possible
    					user agents that each implement an HTML engine. HTML is a language
    					where the behavior is also specified. In contrast, XAML is a language
    					for referencing constructs that are defined in runtime libraries, and
    					the functional specification of the XAML language itself is minimal
    					(intrinsics; language rules; primitive types). Layout, appearance,
    					type-member sets, roles, etc. are all left up to specific frameworks
    					and vocabularies that use XAML. Behavior associated with a given XAML
    					construct is based on type definitions made in a runtime library. For
    					Silverlight XAML, the types are from Silverlight core libraries, but
    					often the definitions come from libraries that are available to the
    					Silverlight runtime as part of an application's packaging for distribution. </p>
    				<p>XAML is generally speaking strict, and will raise parsing errors if
    					XAML contains elements that are not recognized. Such parsing errors
    					generally present the information in the XAML from resulting in any
    					objects being created, which in turn prevents a Silverlight application
    					from running. This is different from typical (non-xHTML) HTML, where
    					implementations are permitted to contain nonrecognized elements or
    					attributes and ignore them. </p>

    						<head> More about design tools and XAML </head>
    						<p>Silverlight XAML is able to be loaded by design tools for Silverlight.
    							In the design tool, the XAML is interpreted much like the runtime interprets
    							it, in order to show the visual representation of the Silverlight application.
    							In addition, the design tool might implement design surfaces in which
    							the user interface can be changed, and typically provides a way to
    							save any changes made in the tool back into the loaded XAML. </p>
    						<p>At design time, tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio or Microsoft
    							Expression might provide opportunities to correct any XAML errors before
    							the Silverlight application is compiled and packaged for deployment.
    							This might be implemented by performing static analysis of the XAML,
    							by forwarding the design tool's own parser errors as it renders the
    							design surface, or by forwarding linking errors that are identified
    							by a precompile step (for example, missing event handlers raise a XAML
    							error from precompile). This behavior is sometimes identified as a <emph>design
    								mode</emph> behavior in Microsoft documentation and other documentation
    							about Visual Studio or specific tools. </p>
    						<p>Regardless of how a given XAML file behaves while being interacted
    							with in a design mode, it is the Silverlight runtime XAML parser on
    							each client installation that is the ultimate determinant of whether

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use the default Silverlight
    				tab sequence, or alternatively to apply the options that Silverlight
    				application authors can use for altering the tab sequence. Application
    				authors might alter the tab sequence in cases where the default tab
    				sequence is not desirable for some reason, and those reasons might
    				vary per application or application scenario. The tab sequence can
    				be altered in order to create a meaningful sequence in the tab order,
    				so that assistive technologies that rely on traversal of focusable
    				elements can use and determine the meaningful sequence. </p>
    			<p>Silverlight uses structured definitions for defining its user interface
    				presentations, where the declaration order is significant because it
    				becomes the structure of the run-time visual tree. The structured definitions
    				also define the layout and presentation structure in most cases. The
    				structured definition concept is described in more detail in <specref ref="silverlight_notes"/>. </p>
    			<p>The Silverlight development platform attempts to create an overall
    				system where the logical order of how elements are defined in XAML
    				and code, and then presented in a user interface, will also match a
    				logical tab sequence and logical reading order when presented to the
    				user. In many cases, a Silverlight application author can write an
    				application without necessarily worrying about the tab sequence, can
    				test the tab sequence during a verification and testing phase of development,
    				and will not need to set any specific properties to adjust the tab
    				sequence. As a broad generalization, a Silverlight tab sequence will
    				be constructed so that it traverses elements left to right, and top
    				to bottom, and will behave similarly to how HTML would behave if the
    				HTML analogs of Silverlight elements were constructed and presented
    				in the same way. However, there are specific Silverlight controls that
    				deliberately alter the tab sequence, or whose elements are made keyboard-accessible
    				through a keyboard navigation technique other than TAB. For more information,
    				see <loc href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc903954%28VS.95%29.aspx">Focus
    				Overview on MSDN</loc>. </p>
    			<section id="SL34_tab-sequence">
    				<head> How Silverlight implements tab sequence concepts </head>
    				<p>The Silverlight programming model defines a <obj>Control</obj> class
    					that is a base class of many of the practical controls that produce
    					a Silverlight application user interface. One of the behaviors of the <obj>Control</obj> class
    					is that only a <obj>Control</obj> can receive keyboard focus
    					as a discrete element within the Silverlight content area. </p>
    				<p>When a Silverlight application user interface is constructed from
    					the visual tree, a default tab sequence for all Silverlight content
    					is also constructed, using the same principles of order that were used
    					by the visible layout. This default tab sequence is usually adequate
    					as a tab sequence that supports users that press the TAB key to traverse
    					the UI. The same TAB sequence and/or the focusable state of controls
    					is also used by many assistive technologies or modes of assistive technologies
    					to construct the representation of the interface for the Silverlight
    					content. </p>
    				<p>For cases where developers decide that the default tab sequence is
    					not adequate, the developer can take one of two approaches for changing
    					the tab sequence: </p>
    				<ulist><item><p> Change other properties of the control where a change to the tab
    				sequence happens as a secondary effect. </p></item><item><p> Reorder the tab sequence directly. </p></item></ulist>

    			<p>The objective of this technique is to use the Silverlight <obj>Validation</obj> API.
    				The <obj>Validation</obj> API associates the validation logic with form input
    				elements that properly support accessible text both for the initial
    				entry and for any error identification and suggestion that is displayed
    				in the user interface. </p>
    			<p>Application authors can either associate <prop>Validation.Errors</prop> output
    				with specific UI elements, include an initially hidden <obj>ValidationSummary</obj> user
    				interface element, or both. The example shown in this technique uses
    				both <obj>ValidationSummary</obj> and <prop>Validation.Errors</prop>.
    				The <obj>ValidationSummary</obj> is the most appropriate technique
    				for providing text feedback after a form submission attempt, because
    				assistive technologies pick it up as a discrete focusable element in
    				the interface representation. The <prop>Validation.Errors</prop> technique
    				is perhaps a better cognitive user experience for sighted users, because
    				it presents the specific error suggestions in closer proximity to the
    				input items that are in error. </p>
    			<p>This technique relies on several Silverlight features: <obj>AutomationProperties</obj>,
    				the <prop>Name</prop> property for identifying specific UI elements,
    				the <obj>Validation</obj> and <obj>ValidationSummary</obj> API,
    				the ElementName variation of Silverlight data binding, and the general
    				behavior of <obj>TextBox</obj> elements. </p>

    					of the foreground text do not satisfy the 4.5:1 contrast ratio per
    					SC 1.4.1. To correct for this visual bug, application authors should
    					copy the control template for the <obj>Label</obj> control, and
    					adjust the color used for the validation state. This is shown in Example
    					1; the resource   "LabelStyle1" was generated by copying
    					the default <obj>Label</obj> style using Microsoft Expression
    					Blend. Then, the value was changed in the copied template, and the
    					changed template was referenced and included in the application. The
    					specific changed line is indicated by a comment in the Example 1 sample
    					markup. </p>

    				<head>Two form fields with validation on Submit, and an error
    					identification/suggestion system and UI on the client side</head>
    				<description>
    					<p>In this example, the form fields correspond to a data object that
    						implements a view model. Silverlight uses the view model and data annotations
    						to generate some of its UI, notably the names of the fields are bound
    						to the original view model names from the data. The <obj>ValidationSummary</obj> 
    							API is defined in a "Client SDK" library System.Windows.Controls.Data.Input.dll,
    						which is included as part of the project and the distributable. </p>
    					<p>This example has a UI defined in XAML and logic defined in C#. The
    					following is the XAML UI. </p>
