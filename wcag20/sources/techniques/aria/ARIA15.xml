   <description>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide descriptions of images when a short text alternative does not adequately convey the function or information provided in the object. 
</p>
      <p>A feature of WAI-ARIA is the ability to associate descriptive text with a section, drawing, form element, picture, and so on using the <prop>aria-describedby</prop> property. This is similar to the <att>longdesc</att> attribute in that both are useful for providing additional information to help users understand complex images. Like <att>longdesc</att>, descriptive text provided using <att>aria-describedby</att> is separate from the short name provided using the <att>alt</att> attribute in HTML. Unlike <att>longdesc</att>, <att>aria-describedby</att> cannot reference descriptions outside of the page containing the image. An advantage of providing long descriptions using content from the same page as the image is that the alternative is available to all, including sighted people who do not have assistive technology. It is worth noting that as of the time of writing (October 2013) some assistive technologies read <att>aria-describedby</att> content immediately after an image's alt attribute information without user activation - whereas most implementations of <att>longdesc</att> require the user to take explicit action to read the additional description.
</p>
      <p>Like <att>aria-labelledby</att>, <att>aria-describedby</att> can accept multiple ids to point to other regions of the page using a space separated list. It is also limited to ids for defining these sets.
</p>

   <examples>
      <eg-group>
         <head>Describing an image</head>
         <description>
            <p>The following example shows how <att>aria-describedby</att> can be applied to an image to provide a long description, where that text description is on the same page as the image.
