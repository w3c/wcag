      <p>The objective of this technique is use the HTML <att>Lang</att> attribute on
    				the object tag to describe each Silverlight plug-in instance on the
    				HTML hosting page as a "part" that has a different language.
    				Assistive technologies that use HTML Lang as a determinant of language
    				of parts can thus treat all Silverlight content as using that HTML
    				Lang-declared language. </p>
      <p>Most assistive technologies that are capable of determining Language
    				for Web content will use the HTML Lang tag value as the determinant
    				of the language of the page. Assistive technologies would also use
    				HTML Lang tag values for the language of parts. HTML Lang is not specifically
    				reported in accessibility frameworks. Assistive technologies would
    				typically access the HTML DOM to get this information. This technique
    				specifically addresses this known situation regarding how ATs obtain
    				Language information from HTML rather than from accessibility frameworks
    				that otherwise report other aspects of HTML content. </p>
      <p>In order to support different language parts that each contain Silverlight
    				content, authors declare one Silverlight object tag per continuous
    				language part region in the HTML. For example, the following HTML is
    				a simplication of HTML markup for a page that contains two Silverlight
    				content areas, the first declaring Lang as English (en), the second
    				declaring Lang as German (de): </p>

      <p>To support communication between different Silverlight plug-in instances
    				that are hosted on the same HTML page, application authors can use
    				various techniques, including the following </p>
      <ulist>
         <item>
            <p> System.Windows.Messaging APIs: this is the simplest technique,
    				and this is shown in Example 1 </p>
         </item>
         <item>
            <p> Using a shared business object, and exchanging information by
    					having each Silverlight instance reference two-way data binding to
    					that business object's properties. </p>
         </item>
         <item>
            <p> Exchanging information through the HTML DOM and declaring properties
    					of one or both instances as Scriptable by the DOM. </p>

         <p>Regardless of how HTML Lang is declared on the defining object tags,
    					many aspects of how Silverlight works with language and culture information
    					at run time are not determined by HTML Lang, and are instead determined
    					by the operating system and which culture that operating system is
    					running. For more information, see <loc xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

         <head>Two Silverlight object tags, each with different HTML
    					Lang, to support a simple language-translator application as a Web
    					page</head>
         <description>
            <p>The Visual Studio solution for this example has a total of 4 project
    						components: </p>
            <ulist>
               <item>
                  <p> The Web project that declares the HTML or ASP page that shows
    						the framework of how the two Silverlight object tags exist on a page.
    						This is where the HTML Lang is actually set. </p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p> A project for the English user control, a simple <obj>TextBox</obj>. </p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p> A project for a German user control, also a simple <obj>TextBox</obj>. </p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p> A library with a static translation function </p>
               </item>
            </ulist>
            <p>In this example, the English user control implements a LocalMessageSender,
    						which sends asynchronous messages to the German user control. The German
    						user control has a LocalMessageReceiver, which is set to listen as
    						soon as the control is instantiated. When a message is received, the
    						German control calls a function of the translation library, and displays
    						translated text. </p>
            <p>The following is the HTML page (some infrastructure and parameters
    					omitted for clarity): </p>
            <codeblock xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

            <p>The following is the XAML for the English user control: </p>
            <codeblock xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<UserControl x:Class="SilverFish.MainPage"
   xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"

   <Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot" Background="White">
       <TextBox AcceptsReturn="False" Language="en-us"
       Name="EnglishTranslationBox" 
       LostFocus="EnglishTranslationBox_LostFocus"/>
   </Grid>
</UserControl>
]]></codeblock>
            <p>The following is the code-behind for the English user control: </p>
            <codeblock xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[   public partial class MainPage : UserControl
   {
       private LocalMessageSender messagesender;
       public MainPage()
       {
           InitializeComponent();
       }
       private void EnglishTranslationBox_LostFocus(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
       {
           messagesender = new LocalMessageSender("receiver");
           messagesender.SendAsync((sender as TextBox).Text);
       }
   }
   ]]></codeblock>
            <p>The following is the code-behind for the German user control (the
    						XAML is minimal; the main relevant point is that it contains a <obj>TextBox</obj> target
    						named GermanTranslationBox). The code invokes the translation function
    						found in a separate library. The translation function is not shown,
    						it simply takes an English string and returns a German translation. </p>
            <codeblock xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[   public partial class MainPage : UserControl
   {
       public MainPage()
       {

           lmr.MessageReceived += new EventHandler<MessageReceivedEventArgs>(lmr_MessageReceived);
           try

       void lmr_MessageReceived(object sender, MessageReceivedEventArgs e)
       {
           if (e.Message!="") {
               String translated;
               translated = Translator.TranslateThat(e.Message);
               GermanTranslationBox.Text = translated;
               GermanTranslationBox.Focus();
           }
