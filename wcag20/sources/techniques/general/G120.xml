   <description>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to make the pronunciation of a word available by providing the pronunciation after the word at least the first time it occurs within a Web page.</p>
      <p>When a Web page contains words with the same spelling but different pronunciations, this technique is not appropriate for providing the pronunciation unless it is provided for each instance.</p>
      <p>This technique is applied to the first occurrence of an abbreviation in a Web page. When combining multiple resources into a single Web page, the abbreviation would be expanded at the beginning of each resource. In this case, however, using a different technique for providing the expanded form may be more appropriate.</p>
