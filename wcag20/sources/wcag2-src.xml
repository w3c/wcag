    <abstract>
    	<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. 
        Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general. 
      </p>
        <p>WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See <loc href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</loc> for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.

    	<p>WCAG 2.0 succeeds <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</loc>
    		<bibref ref="WCAG10"/>, which was published as a W3C Recommendation May 1999. Although it is possible to conform either to WCAG 1.0 or to WCAG 2.0 (or both), the W3C recommends that new and updated content use WCAG 2.0. The W3C also recommends that Web accessibility policies reference WCAG 2.0.</p>

      <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0  defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general. 
      </p>
      <p>WCAG 2.0 is developed through the <loc href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process.php">W3C process</loc> in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for Web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.0 builds on WCAG 1.0 <bibref ref="WCAG10"/> and is designed to apply broadly to different Web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the <loc href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</loc>.</p>
      <p>Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible Web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in Web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of Web development and interaction work together, see:</p>

        <head>WCAG 2.0 Layers of Guidance</head>
          <p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include Web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall <emph>principles</emph>, general <emph>guidelines</emph>, testable <emph>success criteria</emph> and a rich collection of <emph>sufficient techniques, advisory techniques</emph>, and <emph>documented common failures</emph> with examples, resource links and code.</p>
        <ulist>
          <item>
            <p>
              <emph role="bold">Principles</emph> - At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for Web accessibility: <emph>perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust</emph>. See also <loc href="intro" locn-note="introduction-fourprincs-head" linktype="understanding">Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility</loc>.</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>
              <emph role="bold">Guidelines</emph> - Under the principles are guidelines. The 12 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>
              <emph role="bold">Success Criteria</emph> - For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.0 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest).  Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in <loc href="conformance" locn-note="uc-levels-head" linktype="understanding">Understanding Levels of Conformance</loc>.</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>
              <emph role="bold">Sufficient and Advisory Techniques</emph> - For each of the <emph>guidelines</emph> and <emph>success criteria</emph> in the WCAG 2.0 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of <emph>techniques</emph>. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are <emph>sufficient</emph> for meeting the success criteria and those that are <emph>advisory</emph>. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also <loc href="intro" locn-note="introduction-layers-techs-head" linktype="understanding">Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.0</loc>.</p>
          </item>
        </ulist>
        <p>All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users.</p>
      	<p>Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the <phrase diff="chg">cognitive, language, and learning areas</phrase>.  Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that Web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. <loc linktype="understanding" href="understanding-metadata">Metadata</loc> may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs.

          WCAG 2.0 Supporting Documents
        </head>
        <p>The WCAG 2.0 document  is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical standard. 
          Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on the WCAG 2.0 document and address other important purposes, including the ability to be updated to describe how WCAG would be applied with new technologies. Supporting documents include:

        <head>Important Terms in WCAG 2.0</head>
        <p>
          WCAG 2.0 includes three important terms that are different from WCAG 1.0.
          
          Each of these is introduced briefly below and defined more fully in the glossary.

            <label>Web Page</label>
            <def>
              <p>It is important to note that, in this standard, the term "<termref def="webpagedef">Web page</termref>" includes much more than static HTML pages. It also includes the increasingly dynamic Web pages that are emerging on the Web, including "pages" that can present entire virtual interactive communities. For example, the term "Web page" includes an immersive, interactive movie-like experience found at a single URI. For more information, see <loc href="conformance" locn-note="uc-web-page-head" linktype="understanding">Understanding "Web Page"</loc>.</p>
            </def>

          <gitem id="programmatically-determined_def">
            <label>Programmatically Determined</label>
            <def>
              <p>Several success criteria require that content (or certain aspects of content) can be "<termref def="programmaticallydetermineddef">programmatically determined</termref>." This means that the content is delivered in such a way that <termref def="useragentdef">user agents</termref>, including <termref def="atdef">assistive technologies</termref>, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities. For more information, see <loc href="conformance" locn-note="uc-programmatically-determined-head" linktype="understanding">Understanding Programmatically Determined</loc>.

          <gitem id="accessibility-supported_def">
            <label>Accessibility Supported</label>
            <def>
                <p>Using a technology in a way that is accessibility supported means that it works with assistive technologies (AT) and the accessibility features of operating systems, browsers, and other user agents. Technology features can only be <termref def="reliedupondef">relied upon</termref> to conform to WCAG 2.0 success criteria if they are used in a way that is "<termref def="accessibility-supporteddef">accessibility supported</termref>". Technology features can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported (do not work with assistive technologies, etc.) as long as they are not relied upon to conform to any success criterion (i.e., the same information or functionality is also available another way that is supported). </p>
              <p>
                The definition of "accessibility supported" is provided in the <specref ref="glossary"/> section of these guidelines. For more information, see <loc href="conformance" locn-note="uc-accessibility-support-head" linktype="understanding">Understanding Accessibility Support</loc>. </p>

                <p>The WCAG Working group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive technologies there must be for a particular use of a Web technology in order for it to be classified as accessibility supported. (See <loc href="conformance" locn-note="uc-support-level-head" linktype="understanding">Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"</loc>.)</p>
                <p>Web technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long as they are not <termref def="reliedupondef">relied upon</termref> and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including <specref ref="cc4"/> and <specref ref="cc5"/>, are met.</p>
                <p>When a <termref def="technologydef">Web Technology</termref> is used in a way that is "accessibility supported," it does not imply that the entire technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to meet WCAG requirements.</p>
              <p>When citing Web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported should be specified.</p>
                <p>One way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported. (See <loc href="conformance" linktype="understanding" locn-note="uc-documented-lists-head">Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses</loc>.) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported ways of using Web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in the documentation would need to meet the definition of  accessibility-supported Web content technologies above.

            </p>
            <note>
              <p>
                functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

              <p>Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring <abbr expansion="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>.
              </p>
              <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

              <p>Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).</p>
              <p>Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.</p>
              <p>For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no background color is specified, then white is assumed. </p>
              <p>Background color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text color is specified when a background color is specified. </p>
              <p>When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.</p>
              <p>WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except where caused by authors' code.</p>

            <note>
              <p>For general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). (Higher resolutions displays showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.)</p>
              <p>A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists of two opposing transitions. </p>
              <p>The current working definition in the field for <emph role="bold">"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red"</emph> is where, for either or both states involved in each transition, R/(R+  G + B) &gt;= 0.8, and the change in the value of (R-G-B)x320 is &gt; 20  (negative values of (R-G-B)x320 are set to zero) for both transitions.  R, G, B values range from 0-1 as specified in “relative luminance”  definition. <bibref ref="HARDING-BINNIE"/></p>
              <p>Tools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However, no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above).</p>

            <p>with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts
            </p>
            <note>
              <p>Fonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower contrast levels.</p>
              <p>Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing that may be done by a user.</p>
                <p>The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined size and the user's display or user agent settings. For many mainstream body text fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display. The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.
              </p>
              <p>When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from the default sizes in a similar fashion. </p>
                <p>The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt).  For other fonts such as CJK languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those languages and the next larger standard large print size.</p>

              <p>A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of different content modules.</p>
              <p>When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet floating alongside. This might be a single-page Web site or just one page within a Web site.</p>
