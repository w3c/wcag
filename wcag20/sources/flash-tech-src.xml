			<p>This version of CSS techniques has not significantly changed since the 19 November 2004 Working Draft. The <loc href="/WAI/GL/">Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</loc> (WCAG WG) has focused on addressing issues related to Guidelines and Success Criteria. This publication  demonstrates how the different documents may link to each other. As the focus of the WCAG WG returns to techniques and test suites, the structure and presentation of the techniques documents will likely change to  reflect the relationships between Guidelines, Techniques, and testing documents. In future revisions, we expect to distinguish between techniques required for conformance versus those that are optional. Please refer to "<loc href="http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/css_issues.php">Issue tracking for WCAG 2.0 Techniques for CSS</loc>" for a list of open issues related to this Working Draft.

		<abstract>
			<p>This document provides information to Web content developers who wish to satisfy the Success Criteria of "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0" <bibref ref="WCAG20"/> (currently a W3C Working Draft).   The techniques in this document are specific to Flash content <bibref ref="FLASH"/>.  Use of the illustrative techniques provided in this document may make it more likely for Web content to demonstrate conformance to WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria (by passing the relevant tests in the WCAG 2.0 test suite - <emph>to be developed</emph>) than if these illustrative techniques are not used.</p>
			<p>There may be other techniques besides those provided in this document that may be used to demonstrate conformance to WCAG 2.0; in that case, it is encouraged to submit those techniques to the WCAG WG for consideration for inclusion in this document, so that the set of techniques  maintained by the WCAG WG is as comprehensive as possible. Deprecated examples illustrate techniques that the Working Group no longer recommends, but may be applicable in some cases. </p>
			<p>This document is part of a series of documents published by the W3C
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to support WCAG 2.0.</p>

				<p>Adobe Flash Player is a cross-platform browser plug-in. Authors  creating content for display by the Flash Player may choose to do so for   a variety of factors,  including video support, authoring preference, vector-based graphics   capabilities, or to take  advantage of available components. The motivation of the author  notwithstanding, it is equally important to ensure that content playing   in the Flash Player meets  the accessibility criteria in WCAG 2.0 as it is for other web content. </p>
				<div3 id="flash_ua_support">
					<head>User Agent Support for Flash</head>
					<p>The Flash Player  provides a combination of built-in support for accessibility and   capabilities that authors and  authoring tools can take advantage of in order to enable support for   accessible content.  Flash authors may use any of a few tools for authoring accessible Flash   content,  including but not limited to: </p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p> Flash MX, MX2004, 8, CS3, CS4, CS5 </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Flex 1.5 and newer </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Flex Builder 2, Flex Builder 3, Flash Builder 4 </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Flash Catalyst 4 </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Other tools, including Adobe Presenter and Adobe Captivate </p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
					<p>For blind, low-vision, and other assistive technology users the Flash   Player  introduced support for an accessibility API in 2001 with Flash Player 6.   Flash  accessibility support for assistive technology relies on the Microsoft   Active  Accessibility (MSAA) interface and a Flash Player-specific interface to   properly  convey information about Flash content for assistive technologies.   Support for  assistive technologies is provided for users viewing content using   combinations of: </p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p> Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or later, in combination with   Flash Player 6 or newer on Windows. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Mozilla Firefox 3 or later, in combination with Flash Player 9   or later on Windows. </p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
					<p>Assistive technology support for MSAA is provided in several   assistive technologies,  including but not limited to: </p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p> JAWS (4.5 and newer) </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Window-Eyes (4.2 and newer) </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> NVDA </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> ZoomText (8 and newer) </p>
						</item>
					</ulist>

					<p>Flash Player also supports keyboard access for users who are unable   to use a mouse.  Keyboard support is best within the ActiveX version of the player used   in Internet Explorer,  but techniques to provide support within Mozilla Firefox are also   available. Flash authors can  control the tab order of content within published Flash content, as is   demonstrated in the WCAG  2.0 techniques for Flash. </p>
					<p>Flash Player is often used to display video, and it provides   support for text tracks which can be  used to provide closed captions or subtitles in any language, and it   also supports multiple tracks  of audio, thereby enabling support for video description, and it supports multiple video tracks, enabling the delivery of sign language interpretation for audio-visual   content. </p>
					<p>The Flash Player does not currently support high-contrast mode or   text resizing via the  Windows operating system. However, Flash authors may take advantage of   Flash's support  for Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), other built-in style support, or   Flash's display filter features to  offer alternative views of a Flash-based interface with larger text,   alternative fonts, or alternative  or high-contrast color schemes. </p>
					<p>Flash accessibility support for assistive technology relies on use in Windows operating systems, using Internet Explorer 6 or later (with Flash Player 6 or later) or Mozilla Firefox 3 or later (with Flash Player 9 or later).</p>
					<p diff="del">Adobe continues to improve accessibility support in Flash Player.   In March 2010 Adobe  announced plans to add support for IAccessible2 and support for   accessibility APIs for both Mac  and Linux platforms. </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to show how non-text objects in Flash can be marked so that they can be read by assistive technology.</p>
					<p>The Flash Player supports text alternatives to non-text objects using the <prop>name</prop> property in the accessibility object, which can be defined in ActionScript or within Flash authoring tools.</p>
					<p>When an object contains words that are important to understanding the content, the <prop>name</prop> property should include those words. This will allow the <prop>name</prop> property to play the same function on the page as the object. Note that it does not necessarily describe the visual characteristics of the object itself but must convey the same meaning as the object. </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a long text  alternative that serves the same purpose and presents the same  information as the original non-text content when a short text  alternative is not sufficient. </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to use submit buttons to allow  users to take actions that cause changes of context rather than  allowing changes in context to occur when the value or state of a  non-submit button control is modified. The intended use of a submit  button in this technique is to generate an HTTP request that submits  data entered in a form or to perform an action that triggers a change  in context, so it is an appropriate control to use to initiate this  change. </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to avoid unnecessary duplication  that occurs when adjacent text and iconic versions of a button are  contained in a Flash movie. </p>
					<p>Many kinds of buttons have both a text and iconic button  adjacent to each other. Often the text and the icon button are rendered  in separate buttons, in part to create a slight visual separation from  each other. Although the sighted user can see this slight visual  separation, a blind or low vision user may not be able to recognize the  separation, and be confused by the redundant buttons. To avoid this,  some authors omit specifying the accessible name for the image, but  this would fail Success Criterion 1.1.1 because the text alternative  would not serve the same purpose as the graphical button. The preferred  method to address this is to put the text and image together in one  button symbol instance, and provide a single accessible name for the  button to eliminate duplication of text. </p>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<p>The following examples are for a situation where a button instance  comprised of both an image and text is on the stage. The combined  button in this example uses the instance name 'flashLink1'. </p>
					<p>To create the combined button in Flash Professional: </p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p> Add a graphic object and text to the stage </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Select both objects </p>
						</item>

							<p> Select 'New Symbol' from the Insert menu or hit Ctrl+F8 to create a new button object </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Click on the button object on the stage and enter an instance name in the Properties panel. </p>

					<p>The purpose of this technique is to allow users to choose to have  additional information added to the label of a button or other control  so that it can be understood out of context. </p>
					<p>Some users prefer to have control labels that are  self-contained, where there is no need to explore the context of the  control. Other users find including the context information in each  button to be repetitive and to reduce their ability to use a site.  Among users of assistive technology, the feedback to the working group  on which is preferable has been divided. This technique allows users to  pick the approach that works best for them. </p>
					<p>A control is provided near the beginning of the page that will  expand the labels for controls on the page so that no  additional context is needed to understand the purpose of those  controls. It must always be possible to understand purpose of the  control directly from its label. </p>
					<p>This technique expands the control labels only for the current  page view. It is also possible, and in some cases would be advisable,  to save this preference in a cookie or server-side user profile, so  that users would only have to make the selection once per site. </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to provide a semantic grouping for   related form controls. This allows users to understand the relationship   of the controls and interact with the form more quickly and   effectively. </p>
					<p>In Flash, when related form controls are grouped, this grouping   can be indicated by adding the group's name to each form control's   accessible name. </p>
					<p>Grouping controls is most important for related radio buttons and   checkboxes. A set of radio buttons or checkboxes is related when they   all submit values for a single named field. They work in the same way as   selection lists, allowing the user to choose from a set of options,   except selection lists are single controls while radio buttons and   checkboxes are multiple controls. Because they are multiple controls, it   is particularly important that they be grouped semantically so they can   be more easily treated as a single control. Often, user agents will   present the value of the legend before the label of each control, to   remind users that they are part of the same group. </p>
					<p>It can also be useful to group other sets of controls that are   not as tightly related as sets of radio buttons and checkboxes. For   instance, several fields that collect a user's address might be grouped   together with a legend of "Address". </p>

						<head>Adding a group name to the accessible name of radio buttons</head>
						<description>
							<p>This example shows how the group name for radio buttons in a group   can be made accessible by adding it to each button's accessible name: </p>
							<olist>
								<item>
									<p> Add radio button components to the stage: </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Enter each button's label using its <prop>label</prop> property </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Add the visual group label to the left or above the buttons   added in step 1 </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Select each radio button. In the Accessibility panel, add the   group name to the "Name" field; </p>
								</item>
							</olist>
							<p>Flash will concatenate the group name with each button's individual   name, such as "gender male". </p>
							<p>This approach is illustrated in the screenshot below: </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to provide an option for people   who have hearing impairments or otherwise have trouble hearing the sound   and dialogue in synchronized media to be able to choose to view   captions as an alternative to audio information. With this technique all   of the dialogue and important sounds are provided as text in a fashion   that allows the text to be hidden unless the user requests it. As a   result they are visible only when needed. This can be achieved using the   FLVPlayback and FLVPlaybackCaptioning   components.  Note: when using FLVPlayback skins the closed   caption button is accessible by default, but if implementing custom   skins authors need to test to verify that the button is accessible. </p>

Stop and play the video   content, and for each relevant part of audio information (including   speech, important background noises and event sounds) include the start   and end time code as well as the textual alternative. Tools like Magpie   have advanced features to make this process easier, whereas a text   editor requires you to read the timecodes from your media player and   include them in the XML as illustrated in the sample captions document   below </p>

And reading over the example in the wiki and looking at the example files, it seems they don't match. The example files use an alert, but the wiki describes updating the accessible name. The example seems good, but like it applies to a different technique, which maybe we should document. Either that, we should update the technique, particularly the example it claims to be a working example of, or get the correct example files in place.</edtext>

						<p>JAWS 8.0 or later can be configured to change language automatically   on the basis of the lang attribute. However, it only switches amongst   major languages as indicated by the primary code.

					<p>The objective of this technique is to identify the default language   of the Flash content by providing the lang and/or xml:lang attribute on   the HTML or object elements for the page containing the Flash. The   embedded Flash content will inherit the language specified. If the   entire web page uses the same language, the lang and/or xml:lang   attribute can be placed on the page's HTML element, as described in <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H57.html">H57:   Using language attributes on the html element</loc>. </p>
					<p>Since Flash inherits the language from the HTML or object   element, all text within the Flash content is expected to be in that   inherited language. This means that it is possible to have a Flash   object in the French language on a page that is primarily in another   language, or to have a page with multiple Flash objects, each in a   different language. It is not possible, however, to indicate changes in the human language of content <emph>within</emph> a single Flash object using this technique.</p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to provide   device independence by providing equivalent event handlers in response   to a mouse or focus event. Supporting both mouse and keyboard events   ensures that users will be able to perceive the same information,   regardless of the input device they used. If the event changes the state   of the control, it may be important to change the descriptive name of   the control in the event handlers. </p>

				<description>
					<p>The objective of this technique is to control the Flash Movie's   reading order and tab order by assigning tabIndex values to its elements. </p>
					<p>The tab order is the order in which objects receive input focus when users press the Tab key. The tab order does not necessarily contain the same elements as the reading order does, as the reading order can also contain elements that are not focusable. However, both the reading order and tab order can be controlled using tab index values. </p>
					<p>Flash Player uses a default tab index order from left to right and top to bottom.</p>
					<p>To create a custom reading order, assign a tab index value to every instance on the stage, either through ActionScript or through the Accessibility panel. Create a tabIndex value for every accessible object, not just the focusable objects. For example, dynamic text must have tab indexes, even though a user cannot tab to dynamic text.</p>
					<p>You can create a custom tab-order index in the Accessibility panel for keyboard navigation for the following objects:</p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p>Dynamic text</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Input text</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Buttons</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Movie clips, including compiled movie clips</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Components</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Screens</p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
					<p>Tab focus occurs in numerical order, starting from the lowest index number. After tab focus reaches the highest tab index, focus returns to the lowest index number. When you move tab-indexed objects that are user-defined in your document, or to another document, Flash retains the index attributes. Check for and resolve index conflicts (for example, two different objects on the Stage with the same tab-index number). If two or more objects have the same tab index in any given frame, Flash follows the order in which the objects were placed on the Stage.</p>
					<p>To add a tabIndex value using the Accessibility panel, perform   the following steps for every accessible object on the stage: </p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p> Select the element by clicking on it. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> In the Accessibility panel, enter a numeric value in the "Tab   index"  field. The value must be  a positive integer (up to 65535) that   reflects the order in which the selected object should be read. Elements   with higher tab index values will be read after elements with lower   values.  If two or more objects have the same tab index in any given   frame, Flash follows the order in which the objects were placed on the   Stage. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> To visualize the currently defined tab order, select View &gt;   Show Tab Order. Tab index numbers for individual objects appear in the   upper-left corner of the object. </p>
						</item>
					</olist>
					<note>
						<p>You can also use ActionScript code to create a tab-order index for keyboard navigation. </p>
					</note>
					<p>These steps are illustrated in the screenshots below </p>

						</image>
					</p>
					<note>
						<p>Flash Player no longer requires that you add all of the   objects in a FLA file to a list of tab index values. Even if you do not   specify a tab index for all objects, a screen reader reads each object   correctly. </p>

						<head>Using tabIndex to navigate a column structure</head>
						<description>
							<p>This example contains dynamic TextField instances that are grouped   into columns. To ensure the reading order follows the column structure.   The TextField instances are given a tab index value that corresponds to   their textual content (for example, the TextField containing the text   "Sample Text 3" has a tabindex value of 3. Additionally, a single   TextField is added that has no tabindex value set. This field contains   the text "Not in tab order". Even though this field is visually placed   between sample text 2 and 3, it is placed at the end of the custom tab   order because it is not assigned a tabindex value. </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to invoke a   scripting function in a way that is keyboard accessible by attaching it   to keyboard-accessible, standard Flash components provided by the Adobe   Flash Professional authoring tool. In order to ensure that scripted   actions can be invoked from the keyboard, they are associated with   standard Flash components such as the Button component. The click event   of these components is device independent. While the "CLICK" event is a   mouse event, it is actually mapped to the default action of a button.   The default action occurs when the user clicks the element with a mouse,   but it also occurs when the user focuses the element and hits the space   key, and when the element is triggered via the accessibility API. </p>

						<p>The problem targeted by this technique only occurs in browsers other   than Internet Explorer. Currently however, this technique works in Firefox on Windows and OSX, and for Google Chrome and Safari 5 on OSX. The Windows versions of Chrome and Safari do not currently shift focus to and from plug-ins correctly. Additionally, JavaScript   needs to be enabled for this technique to work. </p>
					</ua-issue>
				</ua-issues>
				<description>
					<p>The objective of this technique is to allow keyboard focus to move to and from Flash content embedded in a web page. In browsers other than Internet   Explorer, there is a problem related to keyboard accessibility of   embedded Flash content. The problem is that, while both the Flash   content and the HTML content around it may be keyboard accessible, many browsers do not support moving keyboard focus between the Flash content and HTML   content without using a mouse. Once focus is placed inside the Flash   content, a keyboard user will be trapped there. Similarly, when focus is   placed somewhere else on the HTML content (outside the Flash content), it   will be impossible to move focus into the content.  This technique is designed to let the Flash author address this issue and provide support for moving focus between the Flash content and the HTML content via the keyboard. </p>
					<p>This issue has been around for a long time, and is related to the   way browsers implement embedded plug-ins. Until this problem is fixed,   it is up to the Flash developer to come up with a work around. This   technique is one of those workarounds. The approach behind this   technique is the following: </p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p> Two 'neighbor' focusable HTML objects are identified for each   Flash content in the document (one before and one after the content). These   elements can be any HTML elements that are part of the web page's tab   order (such as links and form controls). </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> The Flash content object itself is added to the document tab   order as well, making it possible to tab into the content. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Inside the Flash content, the Flash Player maintains its own tab   order. Normally, when the start or end of the Flash tab order is   reached (when tabbing through the content), focus will wrap to the   beginning or end of the content's tab order, and it will not be possible   to (shift) tab out of it. With this technique however, when a 'focus   wrap' is detected focus will instead be moved to the neighboring element   in the HTML tab order (allowing a keyboard user to 'break out' of the   Flash tab order). </p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
					<p>When the SWFFocus class is imported into a Flash project, the   following will happen: </p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p> A JavaScript &lt;script&gt; tag will be generated   and added to the HTML document containing the Flash content. This   JavaScript code will:</p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p> Set a tabIndex value of "0" on the &lt;object&gt; element of   each Flash content found in the page. This causes the Flash objects to   become part of the tab order. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Optionally, create a hidden anchor element before and after   the Flash content, which is used by the SWFFocus class to move focus out   of the Flash content back into the HTML page. Alternatively, the developer   can specify existing focusable HTML elements as adjacent tab stops for   the Flash content. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Set event handlers for the Flash content object, so that when it   receives focus, the SWFFocus class is notified to manage the content's   internal tab order. </p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> The SWFFocus class monitors changes in focus within the Flash   content. When a focus wrap is detected in the content, a JavaScript function   will be called to instead move focus back to the neighboring HTML   content. </p>

					<p>As indicated above, there are two ways in which this technique can be   used: </p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p>Letting the SWFFocus class generate neighboring focusable   elements in the HTML tab order for each Flash content (demonstrated in   example 1 below)</p>
							<p>By default, the SWFFocus class will create a hidden link   element before and after an embedded Flash content. These elements are   needed as 'anchor' to move focus to when (shift) tabbing out of the   Flash content. This approach is the easiest to implement, as it does not   require any additional work by the developer. The downside is that the   hidden links will clutter the HTML tab order with meaningless elements   (although these elements are only used as tab stops when tabbing _out   of_ the Flash content, not when tabbing _into_ it). Because of this, it is   recommended to use the following approach instead:</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Explicitly identifying focusable HTML elements that come before   and after the a Flash content in the HTML tab order (demonstrated in   example 2 below)</p>
							<p>With this approach, the developer can use ID values to   identify the elements that come before and after the Flash content in the   HTML tab order. This is done by setting special class names on the Flash   content's &lt;object&gt; element. This is the preferred   approach, as it does not cause an unnecessary cluttering of the tab   order. However, it does require more work and awareness by the developer   (who has to manually set ID values). Also, in some scenarios there   simply may not be a next or previous focusable element for a Flash   content.</p>
						</item>
					</olist>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<p>The two examples below are shown in the <loc href="keyboard_trap_fix_custom_as3.html" linktype="examples">working example of Preventing a keyboard trap in Flash content</loc>. The example html file has two Flash contents embedded in it. The first Flash content is embedded with the approach described in example 1. The second example is embedded with the approach described in example 2. The <loc href="keyboard_trap_fix_custom_as3.zip" linktype="examples">source of Preventing a keyboard trap in Flash content</loc> is available. The source zip file contains the SWFFocus class.</p>
					<note>
						<p>To run the example from a local drive (as opposed to running it from a web server), the local directory needs to be added to Flash Player's security settings. </p>
					</note>

						<head>Using automatically generated links</head>
						<description>
							<p>In this example, the SWFFocus class is used without explicitly   identifying focusable HTML elements. This will cause SWFFocus to   dynamically insert hidden links before and after the Flash content. </p>
							<exsubhead>Loading the Flash Content</exsubhead>
							<p>The Flash object in this example is added using <loc href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/documentation#How_to_embed_Flash_Player_content_using_SWFObject_static_publish">SWFObject's dynamic publishing method</loc>, which means   that the object tag is created dynamically by JavaScript in a way that   the browser supports. While this is the recommended approach, it is not a   requirement for using this technique. The SWFFocus class will also work   when the object tag is hardcoded into the HTML document. </p>
							<p>The sample code below shows how to load the content dynamically   with SWFObject. </p>

							<exsubhead>Importing and Initializing the SWFFocus class in Flash</exsubhead>
							<p>The SWFFocus class needs to be added to a Flash or Flex project's source   path. The easiest way to achieve this is to import the SWFFocus.swc into Library path for your project or to copy the   com/swffocus/SWFFocus.as file (including the nested directory structure)   to the project's root directory. </p>
							<p>When the SWFFocus class is added to the content's source path, it   needs to be initialized with the following code: </p>
						</description>
						<code xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[import com.adobe.swffocus.SWFFocus;
SWFFocus.init(stage);]]></code>
						<description>
							<p>The code for the class itself can be found in the source files.</p>
						</description>

							<p>For a large part, this technique is the same as example 1 : </p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p> The dynamic loading approach by SWFObject is used to load the   Flash content </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> The SWFFocus class needs to be added to the content's sourcepath   and initialized in the Flash content </p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
							<p>For more details about these steps, see example 1. </p>
							<p>In this case however, special class names are added to the Flash   content object. These class names indicate the ID values of the elements   previous and next of the content in the HTML tab order. The class names   are: </p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p> 'swfPref-&lt;previous ID&gt;', where '&lt;previous element&gt;'   should be the ID value of the previous element in the tab order. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> 'swfNext-&lt;next ID&gt;', where '&lt;next element&gt;' should   be the ID value of the next element in the tab order. </p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
							<p>For example, the HTML code could look like this (notice the added   class names on the object tag): </p>
						</description>
						<code xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" id="focus1">test 1</a>

  type="application/x-shockwave-flash"/>
<a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" id="focus2">test 2</a>]]></code>
						<description>
							<p>Since this example uses SWFObject's dynamic loading, the class names   will have to be specified as attribute when SWFObject is initialized.   This is demonstrated in the code example below. </p>

							<p>Note: this example assumes that the focusable HTML elements exist and   have an ID value at the time SWFObject is called to insert the Flash   content. However, in some situations it is also possible that these   elements do not yet exist when the Flash content is created, or that the   elements will be deleted dynamically at a later point. If this happens,   it is possible to reassign ID values for previous and next focusable   elements. To do this, call the SWFsetFocusIds() method on the Flash   content object, like so: </p>
						</description>
						<code xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[var o = document.getElementById("FlashSample1SWF");
o.SWFsetFocusIds('prevId', 'nextId');]]></code>
						<description>
							<p>From that point on the updated IDs will be used to move focus to when   tabbing out of the Flash content. </p>

					<p>The intent of this technique is to allow a user to turn off sounds   that start automatically when a Flash movie loads. The control to turn   off the sounds should be located near the beginning of the page to allow   the control to be easily and quickly discovered by users . This is   useful for those who utilize assistive technologies (such as screen   readers, screen magnifiers, switch mechanisms, etc.) and those who may   not (such as those with cognitive, learning and language disabilities). </p>
					<p>In this technique, an author includes a control that makes it   possible for users to turn off any sounds that are played automatically.   For maximum accessibility, the control can be added to the HTML   document rather than to the Flash movie. The HTML control will   communicate with the Flash movie through the ExternalInterface class.   This means that the user can control the sound playback without having   to interact with Flash content. If this is not practical, the control   can be provided within the Flash content, provided that the control is   keyboard operable, located early in the tab and reading order, and   clearly labeled to indicate that it will turn off the sounds that are   playing. </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to notify users that they are   almost out of time to complete an interaction. When scripts provide   functionality that has time limits, the script can include functionality   to warn the user of imminent time limits and provide a mechanism to   request more time. 20 seconds or more before the time limit occurs, the   script provides a confirm dialog that states that a time limit is   imminent and asks if the user needs more time. If the user answers "yes"   then the time limit is reset. If the user answers "no" or does not   respond, the time limit is allowed to expire. </p>
					<p>This technique involves time limits set with the setTimeout()   method. If, for example, the time limit should be 60 seconds, you can   set the time limit for 40 seconds (20 seconds less than the desired   timeout) and show a confirm dialog. The confirm dialog sets a new   timeout for the remaining 20 seconds. If the user requests more time, a   new timeout is set. However, if the 20-second "grace period time limit"   expires (meaning 60 seconds have now elapsed), the action appropriate   for the expiry of the 60 second time limit in the original design is   taken. </p>

						<head>Using ActionScript to offer a time limit extension before the timeout expires</head>
						<description>
							<p>This is a basic AS2 example of a time limit that can be extended by   the user.  An alert is shown after 40 seconds of inactivity, warning that the   session is about to expire. The user is given 20 seconds to press the   space bar or click on the "Yes" button.  Note that the 40 second   duration would be insufficient for most tasks and is artificially short   for ease of demonstration. </p>

					<p>The purpose of this technique is to allow the author to use   ActionScript and component skins to apply a strong visual indication   when a component receives focus. In this particular technique, both the   component's background color and border will change. When the component   loses focus, it returns to its normal styling. </p>
					<p>The visual highlights will be applied by switching some of the   component's skin parts. The Standard Flash components each have their   own set of skins that make up the component's visual appearance. Each   part is represented by a MovieClip which can be edited or replaced in   order to customize how the component looks. The most relevant skin for   this technique is the focusRectSkin skin, which is shared   by all components. By default this skin applies a subtle visual   highlight when the component receives focus. </p>
					<p>This technique can be applied through the following steps: </p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p> Create a customized version of focusRectSkin. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Use scripting to associate the component with the customized   skin. </p>
						</item>
					</olist>
					<p>There are two ways to customize a skin: </p>
					<!-- exsubhead? -->
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p>Duplicating Existing Skin</p>
							<p>With this approach you create a copy of the existing focusRect skin   for modification. You will manually have to apply the skin for each   individual component instance (as indicated in step 5 below). </p>
							<olist>
								<item>
									<p> Drag the components you want to style to the stage. This will   ensure the appropriate component related skins are added to the movie's   library. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Open the Library panel, and navigate to the "Component Assets   &gt; Shared" folder. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Right-click (or Ctrl-click on a Mac) on the focusRectSkin   MovieClip, and choose "Duplicate" from the context menu. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Edit the visual border in the skin's MovieClip. For example,   the focus rectangle can be made thicker to stand out more (This step is   illustrated in the screenshot below this list). </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Using ActionScript, associate form component instances with   your customized version of focusRectSkin. This can be achieved using the   setStyle method. </p>
								</item>
							</olist>
							<p>

									<img source="/WAI/WCAG20/Techniques/working-examples/FLASH20/editing_focusrect.png"/>
									<alt>editing a duplicate of focusRectSkin</alt>
								</image>
							</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Modifying Existing Skin </p>
							<p>With this approach, the original focusRect skin is modified. This   means that the changes you make will be applied to the visual focus   indication of _every_ focusable component. </p>
							<olist>
								<item>
									<p> Drag the components you want to style to the stage. This will   ensure the appropriate component related skins are added to the movie's   library. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Open the Library panel, and navigate to the "Component Assets   &gt; Shared" folder. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Open the focusRectSkin MovieClip for editing by double   clicking on it. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> Edit the visual border in the skin's MovieClip. For example,   the focus rectangle can be made thicker to stand out more. </p>
								</item>
							</olist>
							<note>
								<p>With this approach you will override the existing skin. If   you don't want this, follow the "Duplicate Existing Skin" approach   instead. </p>
							</note>
						</item>
					</olist>
					<p>The focusRect skin applies to all focusable Flash components. If you   want to modify other highlights (for example highlights that occur when   hovering over a component with the mouse), you will have to edit   component specific skins individually. For example, to edit the   mouseover highlights for the checkbox component, you will have to modify   or duplicate both Checkbox_overIcon and Checkbox_selectedOverIcon.   Similarly, for the Button component you will have to modify the   Button_over skin. </p>
					<p>Also, keep in mind that the existing skins are automatically   applied on certain events (focus, mouseover, etc.). It is however also   possible to manually switch a skin at a moment of your own choosing   (e.g. to indicate invalid content for a text field). this can also be   achieved this by calling the setStyle method. </p>

				<examples>
					<eg-group>
						<head>A thick blue border to indicate focus</head>
						<description>
							<p>The code below shows an example where form component instances are   associated with a modified version of the focusRectSkin MovieClip. The   result is that the components receive a thick blue border rather than   the default thin border Flash provides. The code makes a reference to a   modified skin called Focus_custom, which has been added to   the movie's library in advance. </p>
							<p>Note that the custom version of focusRectSkin also sets a   transparent yellow background to increase the visual highlight further.   Components such as Buttons and checkboxes will show this background, but   TextInput components will not. To ensure the yellow background will   still be applied to the TextInput instance, the following workaround is   applied: </p>
							<olist>
								<item>
									<p> A duplicate version of the TextInput "normal" skin (which can   be found in the library at "Component Asssets &gt; TextInputSkins &gt;   TextInput_upSkin") is created and edited to show a yellow background. </p>
								</item>
								<item>
									<p> FocusIn, FocusOut, MouseOver and MouseOut handlers are   assigned to the TextInput instance, which temporarily swap the default   "normal" skin with the custom "normal" skin while the component is   focused or hovered over. </p>
								</item>
							</olist>
							<p>Additionally, the button_over skin is duplicated and modified to   change the default mouseover highlights for the button component   instance. The checkbox_overIcon and checkbox_selectedOverIcon skins are   directly modified, which means those changes will be applied to all   checkbox instances. </p>

					<p>The intent of this Technique is to ensure that information and   relationships that are implied visually by data tables are also made   available programmatically. Specifically, the association between table   column headers and their corresponding cells must be exposed to   assistive technology. In Flash, the DataGrid component can be used to   achieve this. When accessibility is enabled for the DataGrid component,   Flash will automatically prepend the column name in front of each cell   value when exposing the grid row's accessible name to assistive   technology. For example, the row in the screenshot below would be   announced by a screen reader as "Row 6 of 13 Name Patty Crawford Bats L   Throws L Year Jr Home Whittier, CA". </p>
					<note>
						<p>The DataGrid component in Flash only supports column   headings, not row headings. </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how to provide keyboard
    				access to a Flash MovieClip that is not keyboard accessible by default.
    				This technique ensures that the element is focusable by setting the
    				<prop>tabEnabled</prop> property, and it ensures that the action can be triggered
    				from the keyboard by providing a keydown handler in addition to a click
    				handler. </p>
				</description>
				<examples>
					<eg-group>
						<head>MovieClip used as a button</head>
						<description>
							<p>In this example, a custom MovieClip is used as a button. To make it
    						keyboard accessible, the MovieClip is placed in the tab order using
    						the tabEnabled. Additionally, redundant event handlers are added so
    						that the custom button responds to both a mouse click and a space bar
    						keypress. Finally, the custom button is provided an accessible name
    						using the MovieClip's <obj>AccessibilityProperties</obj> object. This makes the
    						button's label perceivable by assistive technology. </p>
							<p>This result can be viewed in the <loc href="event_handlers_to_static_objects_as3.html" linktype="examples">working

							<note>
								<p>Using a generic MovieClip is generally not recommended, since
    						the custom button will be perceived as a focusable graphic rather than
    						a button. Instead, a better approach would be to use the standard Flash
    						Button component, or create a new symbol with a type of "button". </p>

					<p>The objective of this technique is to allow the user to extend the
    				default time limit by providing a mechanism to extend the time when
    				scripts provide functionality that has default time limits. In order
    				to allow the user to request a longer time limit, the script can provide
    				a form (for example) allowing the user to enter a larger time limit
    				or indicating that more time is needed. </p>

						<description>
							<p>In this example, the FLVPlayback component is used to create

    						added to manage the playback of extended audio descriptions.
    						This class provides event listeners to listen for cue points
    						in the media that have been identified by the audio description
    						provider. When these cuepoints are reached, an mp3 file containing
    						the corresponding description will start playing. The recorded
    						descriptions have been timed to fit with in the gaps in the
    						movie's dialog. </p>
							<p>By default, audio descriptions will be enabled. A button (which
    						must itself be accessible to meet other success criteria) is
    						provided below the video player that allows the user to turn
    						audio descriptions on or off. </p>

						<head>Providing an additional audio track for descriptions</head>
						<description>
							<p>Audio description can also be provided via an additional audio
    						track that is the same length and plays simultaneously as the
    						primary media, but that only includes sound for the segments
    						when audio description needs to be played and silence at other
    						times. A Flash author can provide a toggle to turn this additional
    						audio track on or off, based on the listener's preference.
    						When the additional track is enabled, there are two parallel
    						audio tracks, one being the primary audio, and the second being
    						the one containing only audio description. It is still necessary
    						to ensure that the audio description and primary audio do not
    						overlap in ways that make comprehension difficult. This method
    						will achieve the same result as the method used in Example

				<description>
					<p>Except for the <obj>CheckBox</obj> and <obj>RadioButton</obj> component, the built in Flash
    				components are not automatically provided an associated label. For
    				these components, label text has to be placed adjacent to their control
    				manually, using the <obj>Label</obj> component. If the 'auto-label' feature is
    				enabled in the Accessibility panel, then the Flash Player will automatically
    				associate the label text for the <obj>TextInput</obj> and <obj>TextArea</obj> components.
    				This means that for these components, it is not necessary to duplicate
    				the label text for the control using the Accessibility panel. The auto
    				label feature is enabled by default. </p>
					<p>Additionally, the auto label feature will enable the Flash Player
    				to automatically add text contained by Button symbols as the symbol's
    				accessible name. This will only work if the Button symbol only consists
    				of one layer, containing the text label. </p>
					<note>
						<p>Since auto-labeling associates labels without human intervention
    				the accuracy of the association should be verified. For more predictable
    				results authors are encouraged to explicitly add labels to all controls. </p>
					</note>
					<p>To auto labeling, perform the following steps: </p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p> Ensure that the textual descriptions for each form control within
    				the flash application are placed adjacent to the control itself. Text
    				eligible to be used for auto-labeling must not be set to be hidden
    				from assistive technology. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Select the movie stage, and open the Accessibility panel. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Ensure that the 'Auto Label' option is checked. This will automatically
    					associate labels with their TextInput and TextArea controls, and
    					add text inside custom button symbols as their accessible name. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> If the auto label behavior is inappropriate to your Flash content,
    						uncheck the 'Auto label' option, and ensure that each control receives
    						a meaningful 'name' value in the Accessibility panel. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> To disable auto labeling for a particular object but not the whole
    							movie, convert the text to the 'dynamic text' type using the 'Property
    							inspector'. Then select it, and uncheck its 'Make object accessible'
    							option in the Accessibility panel. </p>
						</item>
					</olist>
					<note>
						<p>As an alternative to using the Accessibility panel, the auto
    				label feature can also be turned off by setting the <prop>AccessibilityProperties.noAutoLabel</prop>
    				to <propval>true</propval> for the stage object. </p>

							<p>This example shows two TextInput components, a TextArea component

    						a separate label element has been placed to the left of the control.
    						For the TextArea component, the label has been placed above the control.
    						For the custom button, the label text is placed inside the button symbol.
    						Because the "Auto Label" option is enabled in the Accessibility

					<p>The objective of this technique is to specify the width and/or height
    				of an embedded Flash object using relative units such as <unit>em</unit> values.
    				The size of the Flash object is allowed to expand to fill the size
    				of its container (a parent element) by setting the movie width and
    				height to 100%. The container's width and height is set with relative
    				units. This will allow user agents that support text resizing to resize
    				the Flash object in line with changes in text size settings. When the
    				Flash object's dimensions are adjusted its contents will be scaled,
    				making it easier to read for low vision users. </p>
					<note>
						<p>This technique is not necessary to support users who use zoom
    				functionality in their browsers. </p>

						<head>Scaling text while keeping a minimum size</head>
						<description>
							<p>In this example, a Flash object is loaded into an HTML document using <loc href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/documentation#How_to_embed_Flash_Player_content_using_SWFObject_static_publish">SWFObject's
    						dynamic publishing method</loc>. The Flash object's container element
    						is given a class name of "flashPlaceHolder". This class
    						name is then targeted using CSS to set its width and height using
    						relative em values. When the user increases or decreases the browser's
    						text size, the Flash object will scale accordingly. To ensure that
    						the object does not become too small when text size is decreased,
    						the <prop>min-width</prop> and <prop>min-height</prop> properties are set to the default dimensions. </p>

				<description>
					<p>The intent of this technique is to prevent sounds from playing when
    				the Flash movie loads. This is useful for those who utilize assistive
    				technologies (such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, switch mechanisms,
    				etc.) and those who may not (such as those with cognitive, learning
    				and language disabilities). By default, the sound will be played automatically.
    				When a screen reader such as JAWS is detected however, the sound will
    				have to be started manually. </p>
					<p>To perform screen reader detection, Flash provides the <prop>flash.accessibility.Accessibility.active</prop>
    				property. If this property is set to <propval>true</propval>, it means that the Flash
    				player has detected running assistive technology. Based on this flag,
    				the Flash developer can choose to run different functionality. </p>
					<note>
						<p>The Flash Player requires some time to detect active assistive
    				technology and set the <prop>Accessibility.active</prop> property. To get accurate
    				results, do not check for this property immediately on the first frame
    				of the movie. Instead, perform the check 5 frames in or based on a
    				timed event. </p>
						<p>Not every screen reader will be detected using this mechanism.
    				In general, the property will be set to true when any  <abbr expansion="Microsoft Active Accessibility">MSAA</abbr> client
    				is running. </p>
						<p>Other assistive technology tools, including screen magnifiers,
    				or tools not used as assistive technologies may also utilize MSAA in
    				ways that result in <prop>Accessibility.active</prop> being set to <propval>true</propval>. </p>
					</note>

						<description>
							<p>A class called SoundHandler is created which automatically starts
    						playing an MP3 file only when <prop>Accessibility.active</prop> is set to <propval>false</propval>.
    						Note that this example also checks the <prop>flash.system.Capabilities.hasAccessibility</prop>
    						property. This property does not check whether a screen reader is running,
    						but instead indicates whether the Flash Player is running in an environment
    						that supports MSAA (which basically means the Windows operating system). </p>
