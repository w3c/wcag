         <p>This document, "Understanding WCAG 2.0," is an essential guide to  understanding and using <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</loc> 
            <bibref ref="WCAG20"/>. It is part of a series of documents that support WCAG 2.0. Please note that the  contents of this document are informative  (they provide guidance), and not normative (they do not set  requirements for conforming to WCAG 2.0). See <loc href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</loc> for an introduction to WCAG, supporting  technical documents, and educational material.</p>
			<p>WCAG 2.0 establishes a set of Success Criteria to define conformance  to the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines. A Success Criterion is a testable statement  that will be either true or false when applied to specific Web content.  "Understanding WCAG 2.0" provides detailed information about each  Success Criterion, including its intent, the key terms that are used in  the Success Criterion, and how the Success Criteria in WCAG 2.0 help people with different types of disabilities. This document also provides examples of Web content that meet the success  criterion using various Web technologies (for instance, HTML, CSS, XML),  and common examples of Web content that does not meet the success  criterion. </p>
			<p>This document indicates specific techniques to meet each Success Criterion. Details for how to implement each technique are available in <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2.0</loc>, but "Understanding WCAG 2.0" provides the information about the relationship of each technique to the Success Criteria. Techniques are categorized by the level of support they provide for the Success Criteria. "Sufficient techniques" are <emph>sufficient</emph> to meet a  particular Success Criterion (either by themselves or in combination with  other techniques), while other techniques are advisory and therefore optional.  None of  the techniques are <emph>required</emph> to meet WCAG 2.0, although some may be the only  known method if a particular technology is used. "Advisory techniques" are not sufficient to meet the Success Criteria on their own (because they are not testable or provide incomplete support) but it is encouraged that authors follow them when possible to provide enhanced accessibility. </p>
			<p>In addition to techniques for addressing the success criteria, "Common Failures" are also documented. These "Common Failures" are authoring practices that are known to cause Web content to fail to conform to WCAG 2.0. Authors must avoid those practices in order to meet the WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria.</p>
			<p>This document is part of a series of documents published by the W3C Web  Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to support WCAG 2.0. This document was published as a Working Group Note at the same time WCAG 2.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. Unlike WCAG 2.0, is expected that the information in Understanding WCAG 2.0 will be updated from time to time.

				<head>Intro</head>
            <p>Understanding WCAG 2.0 is an essential guide to understanding and using "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0" <bibref ref="WCAG20"/> Although the normative definition and requirements for WCAG 2.0 can all be found in the WCAG 2.0 document itself, the concepts and provisions may be new to some people. Understanding WCAG 2.0 provides a non-normative extended commentary on each guideline and each Success Criterion to help readers better understand the intent and how the guidelines and Success Criteria work together. It also provides examples of techniques or combinations of techniques that the Working Group has identified as being sufficient to meet each Success Criterion. Links are then provided to write-ups for each of the techniques.</p>
				<p>This is not an introductory document. It is a detailed technical description of the guidelines and their Success Criteria. See <loc href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</loc> for an introduction to WCAG, supporting  technical documents, and educational material.
      </p>
				<p>Understanding WCAG 2.0 is organized by guideline. There is an <emph>Understanding Guideline X.X</emph> section for each guideline.  The intent and any advisory techniques that are related to the guideline but not specifically related to any of its Success Criteria are listed there as well.</p>
				<p>The <emph>Understanding Guidelines X.X</emph> section is then followed by a <emph>Understanding Success Criterion X.X.X</emph> section for each Success Criterion of that guideline.   These sections each contain:</p>
				<ulist>
					<item>
						<p>The Success Criterion as it appears in WCAG 2.0</p>
					</item>
					<item>
						<p>Intent of the Success Criterion</p>

					</item>
					<item>
						<p>Common failures of this Success Criterion</p>

					<head>Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility</head>
					<p>The guidelines and Success Criteria are organized around the following four principles, which lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use Web content. Anyone who wants to use the Web must have content that is:</p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p> Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p>This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)</p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p>This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform) </p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p>This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)</p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p>This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)</p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
						</item>
					</olist>
					<p>If any of these are not true, users with disabilities will not be able to use the Web. </p>
					<p>Under each of the principles are guidelines and Success Criteria that help to address these principles for people with disabilities. There are many general usability guidelines that make content more usable by all people, including those with disabilities. However, in WCAG 2.0, we only include those guidelines that address problems particular to people with disabilities. This includes issues that block access or interfere with access to the Web more severely for people with disabilities.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="layers" role="normal">
					<head>Layers of Guidance</head>
					<div4 id="layers-guidelines" role="normal">
						<head>The Guidelines</head>
                  <p>Under each principle there is a list of guidelines that address the principle. There are a total of 12 guidelines. A convenient list of just the guidelines can be found in the <loc href="contents"
                          linktype="guideline">WCAG 2.0 table of contents</loc>. One of the key objectives of the guidelines is to ensure that content is directly accessible to as many people as possible, and capable of being re-presented in different forms to match different peoples' sensory, physical and cognitive abilities.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 id="layers-sc" role="normal">
						<head>Success Criteria</head>
                  <p>Under each guideline, there are Success Criteria that describe specifically what must be achieved in order to <loc href="conformancedef"
                          linktype="guideline">conform</loc> to this standard. They are similar to the "checkpoints" in WCAG 1.0. Each Success Criterion is written as a statement that will be either true or false when specific Web content is tested against it. The Success Criteria are written to be technology neutral.</p>
						<p>All WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria are written as testable criteria for objectively determining if content satisfies the Success Criteria. While some of the testing can be automated using software evaluation programs, others require human testers for part or all of the test.</p>
						<p>Although content may satisfy the Success Criteria, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. Professional reviews utilizing recognized qualitative heuristics are important in achieving accessibility for some audiences. In addition, usability testing is recommended. Usability testing aims to determine how well people can use the content for its intended purpose.</p>
						<p>The content should be tested by those who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the Web. It is recommended that users with disabilities be included in test groups when performing human testing.
            </p>
						<p>Each Success Criterion for a guideline has a link to the section of the How to Meet document that provides:</p>
						<ulist>
							<item>
								<p>sufficient techniques for meeting the Success Criterion,</p>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>optional advisory techniques, and</p>
							</item>

				<head>Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria (suppressed)</head>
				<p>WCAG 2.0 guidelines and success criteria are designed to be broadly applicable to current and future web technologies, including dynamic applications, mobile, digital television, etc. They are stable and do not change.</p>
            <p>Specific guidance for authors and evaluators on meeting the WCAG success criteria is provided in techniques, which include code examples, resources, and tests.

			<head>Documenting Accessibility Support for Uses of a Web Technology</head>
			<p>The documentation of accessibility support for uses of a Web technology  provides the information needed to determine whether it is possible to  satisfy the WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria for a particular environment. </p>

						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Ways of using the technology that are supported by the user agent; ideally, there are ways to meet all of the success criteria, but exceptions should be noted. </p>

						</item>
					</ulist>
				</item>
			</ulist>
			<p>Target environments are defined by the user agents and assistive technologies available to its users. Documentation of accessibility support involves detailed understanding of the ways to use functionality of a  technology to meet success criteria, and also of user agents and assistive technology. Because of this, vendors and developers of Web technologies and user agents are encouraged to provide this information about the accessibility  support of their products. Similarly, developers and vendors of  assistive technology are encouraged to provide this information about  the ways to use Web technologies  that are supported by their products. Authors should need to document the accessibility supported ways to use a technology only  when there is not reliable documentation available from vendors or  testing groups for those uses. </p>
			<p>For a controlled environment, such as a corporate workplace,  the user agents and assistive technologies available may be a specific  set of versions of user agents on a specific set of platforms. To  determine whether uses of a Web technology are accessibility supported in a  target environment, an author checks that the user agents and assistive  technologies available are in the set of supported user agents and assistive technologies listed for those uses in the Accessibility Support  documentation. </p>
			<p>For a target environment like the Internet, authors may need  to consider a much larger set of user agents, including older versions,  and on a wider variety of platforms. </p>
			<p>Environments that use different natural languages are different target environments. For example, the accessibility-supported ways of using technologies for an English language environment may differ from those  for an Arabic language environment, since there may be different user agents and assistive technologies that support these languages.</p>
			<p>The documentation includes version-specific information about all the assistive technologies and all the user agents and the ways  that they interact with one another. If support in these user agents is  similar, it will be straightforward for an author to decide if a documented way of using a technology is accessibility supported. If the uses supported are different in different versions, authors can only rely on the uses that are supported in the versions available to their users in  determining accessibility support. </p>
			<p>If a way of using a technology is not relied upon for conformance, the absence of accessibility support for that use does not prevent conformance of the Web page. So if the unsupported use does not occur in the content, or if there is a conforming version of that content available, the Web page still conforms. For instance, lack of accessibility support for interactive controls in a Web technology would not prevent uses of the Web technology for non-interactive content that are accessibility supported. </p>

			<head>Understanding Metadata</head>
			<p>This section discusses metadata techniques that can be employed to  satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria. For more information about metadata  see resources below. </p>
			<p>At its most basic level, metadata is essentially 'data about data' and is used to both describe and find resources. </p>
			<p>Metadata is a powerful tool that can be used for describing Web  pages and accessible components of Web pages as well as associating  alternate versions of Web content to each other. These descriptions in  turn allows users to locate specific information they need or prefer. </p>
			<p>In conjunction with WCAG, metadata can play a number of roles including: </p>
			<olist>
				<item>
					<p> Metadata can be used to associate conforming alternate  versions of Web pages with Web pages which do not conform, in order to  allow users to find the conforming alternate version when they land on  a non-conforming page that they cannot use. </p>
				</item>
				<item>
					<p> Metadata can be used to locate and also to describe  alternate pages where there are multiple versions of a page which have  been developed, especially where the alternate pages are optimized for  individuals with different disabilities. The user can use the metadata  both to locate the alternate versions and to identify characteristics  of the versions, so that they can find the one that best meets their  needs. </p>
				</item>
				<item>
					<p>In addition to being used for whole pages (as in #1 and #2  above), metadata can be used to describe alternate versions of  subcomponents of a page. Again, the metadata can be used to find  alternate versions of a Web page component as well as to get  descriptions of the alternate versions ( if there are several) in order  to determine which one would best meet the user's needs. </p>
				</item>
			</olist>
			<div2 role="normal" id="understanding-metadata-resources">
				<head>Metadata Resources</head>
				<p>Metadata descriptions often provide values from defined, agreed  vocabularies such as the resource's subject matter or its date of  publication, and are machine readable - software that understands the  metadata scheme in use can do useful tasks not feasible otherwise.  Typically, an object having metadata may have one or more such metadata  descriptions. </p>

				<p>There are some tools available to provide resource descriptions, or  they can be provided manually.
