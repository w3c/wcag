			<p>This document, "Understanding WCAG 2.0," is an essential guide to  understanding and using <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</loc> <bibref ref="WCAG20"/>. It is part of a series of documents that support WCAG 2.0. Please note that the  contents of this document are informative  (they provide guidance), and not normative (they do not set  requirements for conforming to WCAG 2.0). See <loc href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</loc> for an introduction to WCAG, supporting  technical documents, and educational material.</p>
			<p>WCAG 2.0 establishes a set of Success Criteria to define conformance  to the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines. A Success Criterion is a testable statement  that will be either true or false when applied to specific Web content.  "Understanding WCAG 2.0" provides detailed information about each  Success Criterion, including its intent, the key terms that are used in  the Success Criterion, and how the Success Criteria in WCAG 2.0 help people with different types of disabilities. This document also provides examples of Web content that meet the success  criterion using various Web technologies (for instance, HTML, CSS, XML),  and common examples of Web content that does not meet the success  criterion. </p>
			<p>This document indicates specific techniques to meet each Success Criterion. Details for how to implement each technique are available in <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2.0</loc>, but "Understanding WCAG 2.0" provides the information about the relationship of each technique to the Success Criteria. Techniques are categorized by the level of support they provide for the Success Criteria. "Sufficient techniques" are <emph>sufficient</emph> to meet a  particular Success Criterion (either by themselves or in combination with  other techniques), while other techniques are advisory and therefore optional.  None of  the techniques are <emph>required</emph> to meet WCAG 2.0, although some may be the only  known method if a particular technology is used. "Advisory techniques" are not sufficient to meet the Success Criteria on their own (because they are not testable or provide incomplete support) but it is encouraged that authors follow them when possible to provide enhanced accessibility. </p>
			<p>In addition to techniques for addressing the success criteria, "Common Failures" are also documented. These "Common Failures" are authoring practices that are known to cause Web content to fail to conform to WCAG 2.0. Authors must avoid those practices in order to meet the WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria.</p>
			<p>This document is part of a series of documents published by the W3C Web  Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to support WCAG 2.0. This document was published as a Working Group Note at the same time WCAG 2.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. Unlike WCAG 2.0, is expected that the information in Understanding WCAG 2.0 will be updated from time to time.

				<p>Understanding WCAG 2.0 is an essential guide to understanding and using "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0" <bibref
					ref="WCAG20"
					/> Although the normative definition and requirements for WCAG 2.0 can all be found in the WCAG 2.0 document itself, the concepts and provisions may be new to some people. Understanding WCAG 2.0 provides a non-normative extended commentary on each guideline and each Success Criterion to help readers better understand the intent and how the guidelines and Success Criteria work together. It also provides examples of techniques or combinations of techniques that the Working Group has identified as being sufficient to meet each Success Criterion. Links are then provided to write-ups for each of the techniques.</p>
				<p>This is not an introductory document. It is a detailed technical description of the guidelines and their Success Criteria. See <loc href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</loc> for an introduction to WCAG, supporting  technical documents, and educational material.
      </p>
				<p>Understanding WCAG 2.0 is organized by guideline. There is an <emph>Understanding Guideline X.X</emph> section for each guideline.  The intent and any advisory techniques that are related to the guideline but not specifically related to any of its Success Criteria are listed there as well.</p>
				<p>The <emph>Understanding Guidelines X.X</emph> section is then followed by a <emph>Understanding Success Criterion X.X.X</emph> section for each Success Criterion of that guideline.   These sections each contain:</p>
				<ulist>
					<item>
						<p>The Success Criterion as it appears in WCAG 2.0</p>

					<head>Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility</head>
					<p>The guidelines and Success Criteria are organized around the following four principles, which lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use Web content. Anyone who wants to use the Web must have content that is:</p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p> Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p>This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)</p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p>This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform) </p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p>This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)</p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>
							<ulist>
								<item>
									<p>This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)</p>
								</item>
							</ulist>
						</item>
					</olist>
					<p>If any of these are not true, users with disabilities will not be able to use the Web. </p>
					<p>Under each of the principles are guidelines and Success Criteria that help to address these principles for people with disabilities. There are many general usability guidelines that make content more usable by all people, including those with disabilities. However, in WCAG 2.0, we only include those guidelines that address problems particular to people with disabilities. This includes issues that block access or interfere with access to the Web more severely for people with disabilities.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 id="layers" role="normal">
					<head>Layers of Guidance</head>
					<div4 id="layers-guidelines" role="normal">
						<head>The Guidelines</head>
						<p>Under each principle there is a list of guidelines that address the principle. There are a total of 12 guidelines. A convenient list of just the guidelines can be found in the <loc href="contents" linktype="guideline">WCAG 2.0 table of contents</loc>. One of the key objectives of the guidelines is to ensure that content is directly accessible to as many people as possible, and capable of being re-presented in different forms to match different peoples' sensory, physical and cognitive abilities.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 id="layers-sc" role="normal">
						<head>Success Criteria</head>
						<p>Under each guideline, there are Success Criteria that describe specifically what must be achieved in order to <loc href="conformancedef" linktype="guideline">conform</loc> to this standard. They are similar to the "checkpoints" in WCAG 1.0. Each Success Criterion is written as a statement that will be either true or false when specific Web content is tested against it. The Success Criteria are written to be technology neutral.</p>
						<p>All WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria are written as testable criteria for objectively determining if content satisfies the Success Criteria. While some of the testing can be automated using software evaluation programs, others require human testers for part or all of the test.</p>
						<p>Although content may satisfy the Success Criteria, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. Professional reviews utilizing recognized qualitative heuristics are important in achieving accessibility for some audiences. In addition, usability testing is recommended. Usability testing aims to determine how well people can use the content for its intended purpose.</p>
						<p>The content should be tested by those who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the Web. It is recommended that users with disabilities be included in test groups when performing human testing.
            </p>
						<p>Each Success Criterion for a guideline has a link to the section of the How to Meet document that provides:</p>
						<ulist>
							<item>
								<p>sufficient techniques for meeting the Success Criterion,</p>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>optional advisory techniques, and</p>
							</item>

				<head>Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria (suppressed)</head>
				<p>WCAG 2.0 guidelines and success criteria are designed to be broadly applicable to current and future web technologies, including dynamic applications, mobile, digital television, etc. They are stable and do not change.</p>
				<p>Specific guidance for authors and evaluators on meeting the WCAG success criteria is provided in techniques, which include code examples, resources, and tests. W3C's <loc href="/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2.0</loc> document is updated periodically, about once a year, to cover more current best practices and changes in technologies and tools.</p>
				<p>The three types of guidance in <loc href="/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2.0</loc> are explained below:</p>

						<item>
							<p>From an evaluator's perspective: If web content implements the sufficient techniques for a given criterion correctly and it is <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-accessibility-support-head">accessibility-supported</loc> for the content's users, it conforms to that success criterion. (The converse is not true; if content does not implement these sufficient techniques, it does not necessarily fail the success criteria, as explained in <loc href="#ut-understanding-techniques-tests-head">Testing Techniques</loc> below.)</p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
					<p>There may be other ways to meet success criteria besides the sufficient techniques in W3C's <loc href="/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2.0</loc> document, as explained in <loc href="#ut-understanding-techniques-othertechs-head">Other Techniques</loc> below. <emph>(See also <loc href="#ut-understanding-techniques-informative-head">Techniques are Informative</loc> above.)</emph></p>

For example, <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/complete#content-structure-separation-programmatic-techniques-head">Sufficient Techniques for 1.3.1</loc> has: "G115: Using semantic elements to mark up structure AND H49: Using semantic markup to mark emphasized or special text (HTML)".</p></div4>

					<p><emph>Advisory techniques</emph> are suggested ways to improve accessibility. They are often very helpful to some users, and may be the only way that some users can access some types of content.</p>

					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p>they may not be sufficient to meet the full requirements of the success criteria;</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>they may be based on technology that is not yet stable;</p>

						</item>
						<item>
							<p>in some circumstances they may not be applicable or practical, and may even decrease accessibility for some users while increasing it for others;</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>they may not address the success criterion itself, and instead provide related accessibility benefits.</p>
						</item>

				<head>Intent</head>
				<p>The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that all non-text content is also available in <loc href="textdef" linktype="glossary">text</loc>. "Text" refers to electronic text, not an image of text. Electronic text has the unique advantage that it is presentation neutral. That is, it
        can be rendered visually, auditorily, tactilely, or by any combination. As a result, information rendered in electronic text can be presented in whatever form best meets the needs of the user. It can also be easily enlarged, spoken aloud so that it is easier for people with reading disabilities to understand, or rendered in whatever tactile form best meets the needs of a user.</p>

					<p>While changing the content into symbols includes changing it into graphic symbols for people with developmental disorders and speech comprehension difficulties, it is not limited to this use of symbols.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by non-text content accessible through the use of a text alternative.  Text alternatives are a primary way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. A person who cannot hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.</p>

              Note on CAPTCHA
            </head>
						<p><abbr
							expansion="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHAs</abbr> are a controversial topic in the accessibility community. As is described in the paper <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</loc>, CAPTCHAs intrinsically push the edges of human abilities in an attempt to defeat automated processes. Every type of CAPTCHA will be unsolvable by users with certain disabilities. However, they are widely used, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group believes that if CAPTCHAs were forbidden outright, Web sites would choose not to conform to WCAG rather than abandon CAPTCHA. This would create barriers for a great many more users with disabilities. For this reason the Working Group has chosen to structure the requirement about CAPTCHA in a way that meets the needs of most people with disabilities, yet is also considered adoptable by sites. Requiring two different forms of CAPTCHA on a given site ensures that most people with disabilities will find a form they can use.</p>
						<p>Because some users with disabilities will still not be able to access sites that meet the minimum requirements, the Working Group provides recommendations for additional steps. Organizations motivated to conform to WCAG should be aware of the importance of this topic and should go as far beyond the minimum requirements of the guidelines as possible. Additional recommended steps include:</p>
						<ulist>
							<item>
								<p>Providing more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs</p>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>Providing access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA</p>

								<p>Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users</p>

						<head>Additional information</head>
						<p>Non-text content can take a number of forms, and this Success Criterion specifies how each is to be handled.</p>
						<p> <emph role="bold">
For non-text content that is not covered by one of the other situations listed below,</emph>
 such as charts, diagrams, audio recordings, pictures, and animations, text alternatives can make the same information available in a form that can be rendered through any modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile).  Short and long text alternatives can be used as needed to convey the information in the non-text content.  Note that <emph
							role="bold">
prerecorded
 audio-only</emph> and 
<emph role="bold"> prerecorded
 video-only</emph> files are covered here.  <emph
							role="bold">
Live-audio-only</emph> and <emph role="bold">
Live-video-only</emph> files are covered below (see 3rd paragraph following this one).  </p>
						<p> <emph role="bold">
For non-text content that is a control or accepts user input</emph>, such as images used as submit buttons, image maps or complex animations, a name is provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content so that the person at least knows what the non-text content is and why it is there.</p>
						<p> <emph role="bold">
Non-text content that is time-based media</emph>
              is made accessible through <specref
							ref="media-equiv"
							/>.  However, it is important that users know what it is when they encounter it on a page so they can decide what action if any they want to take with it.  A text alternative that describes the time-based media and/or gives its title is therefore provided.  </p>
						<p> <emph role="bold">
 For Live Audio-only and live video-only content</emph>, it can be much more difficult to provide text alternatives that provide equivalent information as live audio-only and live video-only content. For these types of non-text content, text alternatives provide a descriptive label.  
</p>
						<p> <emph role="bold">
                Sometimes a test or exercise must be partially or completely presented in non-text format.</emph>  Audio or visual information is provided that cannot be changed to text because the test or exercise must be conducted using that sense.  For example, a hearing test would be invalid if a text alternative were provided.  A visual skill development exercise would similarly make no sense in text form.  And a spelling test with text alternatives would not be very effective.  For these cases, text alternatives should be provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content; of course, the text alternatives would not provide the same information needed to pass the test. </p>
						<p> <emph role="bold">
Sometimes content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience</emph> that words cannot fully capture. Examples include a symphony performance, works of visual art etc. For such content, text alternatives at least identify the non-text content with a descriptive label and where possible, additional descriptive text. If the reason for including the content in the page is known and can be described it is helpful to include that information. </p>
						<p> <emph role="bold">Sometimes there are non-text exercises that are used to prove you are human.</emph> To avoid spam robots and other software from gaining access to a site a device called a CAPTCHA is used. These usually involve visual or auditory tasks that are beyond the current capabilities of Web robots. Providing a text alternative to them would however make them operable by Robots, thus defeating their purpose. In this case a text alternative would describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA, and alternate forms using different modalities would be provided to address the needs of people with different disabilities.</p>
						<p> <emph role="bold">
Sometimes there is non-text content that really is not meant to be seen or understood by the user.</emph> Transparent images used to move text over on a page; an invisible image that is used to track usage statistics; and a swirl in the corner that conveys no information but just fills up a blank space to create an aesthetic effect are all examples of this. Putting alternative text on such items just distracts people using screen readers from the content on the page. Not marking the content in any way, though, leaves users guessing what the non-text content is and what information they may have missed (even though they have not missed anything in reality). This type of non-text content, therefore, is marked or implemented in a way that assistive technologies (AT) will ignore it and not present anything to the user.</p>

				<head>Intent</head>
				<p>The purpose of this guideline is to provide access to time-based and synchronized media.This includes media that is:</p>
				<ulist>
					<item>
						<p>audio-only</p>
					</item>
					<item>
						<p>video-only </p>
					</item>
					<item>
						<p>audio-video </p>
					</item>
					<item>
						<p>audio and/or video combined with interaction </p>
					</item>
				</ulist>
				<p>To make it easy for authors to quickly determine which success criteria apply to their content, the type of media each success criterion applies to is included in its short name. </p>
				<p>For <emph role="bold">audio-only</emph> or <emph role="bold">video-only</emph> media, you only need to apply the success criteria that say "<emph
					role="bold">audio-only</emph>" or "<emph role="bold">video-only</emph>" in their short name. If your media is not <emph
					role="bold">audio-only</emph> or <emph role="bold">video-only</emph>, then all the rest of the success criteria apply.</p>
				<p>Media can also be <emph role="bold">live</emph> or <emph role="bold">prerecorded</emph>. Each of the success criterion short names clearly tells you if the success criterion applies to <emph
					role="bold">live</emph> or <emph role="bold">prerecorded</emph> media. </p>
				<p><term>Synchronized media</term> is defined in the glossary as:</p>
				<p id="copysynchronizedmediadef"/>
				<p>Note that an audio file accompanied by interaction is covered here, as is a video-only file that involves interaction. These are covered because interaction must take place at a particular time. Having a text transcript that said, "for more information, click now," would not be very helpful since the reader would have no idea when the audio said, "now." As a result, synchronized captions would be needed.</p>
				<p>Sometimes, there is so much dialogue that audio description cannot fit into existing pauses in the dialogue. The option at Level A to provide an alternative for time-based media instead of audio description for synchronized media would allow access to all of the information in the synchronized media. This option also allows access to the visual information in non-visual form when audio description is not provided for some other reason. </p>
				<p>For synchronized media that includes interaction, interactive elements (for example links) could be embedded in the alternative for time-based media. </p>
				<p>This guideline also includes (at Level AAA) sign language interpretation for synchronized media as well as an approach called extended audio description. In extended audio description, the video is frozen periodically to allow more audio description to take place than is possible in the existing pauses in the dialogue. This is a case where higher-level Success Criteria build upon the requirements of lower-level Success Criterion with the intention of having cumulative, progressively stronger, requirements.

				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded video-only content available to all users. Alternatives for time-based media that are text based make information accessible because text can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. In the future, text could also be translated into symbols, sign language or simpler forms of the language (future).</p>
					<p>An example of pre-recorded video with no audio information or user interaction is a silent movie. The purpose of the transcript is to provide an equivalent to what is presented visually. For prerecorded video content, authors have the option to provide an audio track. The purpose of the audio alternative is to be an equivalent to the video. This makes it possible for users with and without vision impairment to review content simultaneously. The approach can also make it easier for those with cognitive, language and learning disabilities to understand the content because it would provide parallel presentation.</p>
					<note>
						<p>A text equivalent is not required for audio that is provided as an equivalent for video with no audio information.  For example, it is not required to caption video description that is provided as an alternative to a silent movie.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to watch synchronized media presentations. Captions provide the part of the content available via the audio track. Captions not only include dialogue, but identify who is speaking and include non-speech information conveyed through sound, including meaningful sound effects. </p>
					<p>It is acknowledged that at the present time there may be difficulty in creating captions for time-sensitive material and this may result in the author being faced with the choice of delaying the information until captions are available, or publishing time-sensitive content that is inaccessible to the deaf, at least for the interval until captions are available. Over time, the tools for captioning as well as building the captioning into the delivery process can shorten or eliminate such delays.
          </p>
					<p>Captions are not needed when the synchronized media is, itself, an alternate presentation of information that is also presented via text on the Web page. For example, if information on a page is accompanied by a synchronized media presentation that presents no more information than is already presented in text, but is easier for people with cognitive, language, or learning disabilities to understand, then it would not need to be captioned since the information is already presented on the page in text or in text alternatives (e.g., for images).

				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide people who are blind or visually impaired access to the visual information in a synchronized media presentation. This Success Criterion describes two approaches, either of which can be used.</p>
					<p>One approach is to provide audio description of the video content. The audio description augments the audio portion of the presentation with the information needed when the video portion is not available. During existing pauses in dialogue, audio description provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text that  are important and are not described or spoken in the main sound track.</p>
					<p>The second approach involves providing all of the information in the synchronized media (both visual and auditory) in text form. An alternative for time-based media provides a running description of all that is going on in the synchronized media content. The alternative for time-based media reads something like a screenplay or book. Unlike audio description, the description of the video portion is not constrained to just the pauses in the existing dialogue. Full descriptions are provided of all visual information, including visual context, actions and expressions of actors, and any other visual material. In addition, non-speech sounds (laughter, off-screen voices, etc.) are described, and transcripts of all dialogue are included. The sequence of description and dialogue transcripts are the same as the sequence in the synchronized media itself. As a result, the alternative for time-based media can provide a much more complete representation of the synchronized media content than audio description alone.</p>
					<p>If there is any interaction as part of the synchronized media presentation (e.g., "press now to answer the question") then the alternative for time-based media would provide hyperlinks or whatever is needed to provide the same functionality.</p>
					<note>
						<p>
              For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary. 
              
            </p>
						<p>
              1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other. This is to give the author some choice at the minimum conformance level, and to provide additional requirements at higher levels. At Level A in Success Criterion 1.2.3, authors do have the choice of providing either an audio description or a full text alternative. If they wish to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3, otherwise an additional requirement. At Level AAA under Success Criterion 1.2.8 they must provide an extended text description. This is an additional requirement if both 1.2.3 and 1.2.5 were met by providing an audio description only. If 1.2.3 was met, however, by providing a text description, and the 1.2.5 requirement for an audio description was met, then 1.2.8 does not add new requirements.</p>

							<p>A company purchases a Training video for use by its employees and puts it on the companies intranet. The video involves explaining use of a new technology and has a person talking and showing things at the same time. Since there is no place to insert audio description of the visual demonstrations during gaps in dialogue, the company provides an alternative for time-based media that all employees, including those who cannot see the demonstrations, can use to better understand what is being presented. </p>

					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing and who are fluent in a sign language to understand the content of the audio track of synchronized media presentations. Written text, such as that found in captions, is often a second language. Because sign language provides the ability to provide intonation, emotion and other audio information that is reflected in sign language interpretation, but not in captions, sign language interpretation provides richer and more equivalent access to synchronized media. People who communicate extensively in sign language are also faster in sign language and synchronized media is a time-based presentation.

					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide people who are blind or visually impaired access to a synchronized media presentation beyond that which can be provided by standard audio description.    This is done by periodically freezing the synchronized media presentation and playing additional audio description.  The synchronized media presentation is then resumed.  </p>
					<p>Because it disrupts viewing for those who do not need the additional description, techniques that allow you to turn the feature on and off are often provided.  Alternately, versions with and without the additional description can be provided. </p>

								<p>People who are blind, people with low vision who cannot see the screen, as well as those with cognitive limitations who have difficulty interpreting visually what is happening, often use audio description of the visual information.

				<head>1.2.8</head>
				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make audio visual material available to individuals whose vision is too poor to reliably read <loc
						linktype="glossary" href="captionsdef">captions</loc> and whose hearing is too poor to reliably hear dialogue and <loc
						linktype="glossary" href="audiodescdef">audio description</loc>. This is done by providing an alternative for time-based media.
          </p>
					<p>This approach involves providing all of the information in the synchronized media (both visual and auditory) in text form. An alternative for time-based media provides a running description of all that is going on in the synchronized media content. The alternative for time-based media reads something like a book. Unlike audio description, the description of the video portion is not constrained to just the pauses in the existing dialogue. Full descriptions are provided of all visual information, including visual context, actions and expressions of actors, and any other visual material. In addition, non-speech sounds (laughter, off-screen voices, etc.) are described, and transcripts of all dialogue are included. The sequence of descriptions and dialogue transcripts is the same as the sequence in the synchronized media itself. As a result, the alternative for time-based media can provide a much more complete representation of the synchronized media content than audio description alone.</p>
					<p>If there is any interaction as part of the synchronized media presentation (e.g., "press now to answer the question") then the alternative for time-based media would provide hyperlinks or whatever is needed to provide parallel functionality.</p>
					<p>Individuals whose vision is too poor to reliably read captions and whose hearing is too poor to reliably hear dialogue can access the alternative for time-based media by using a refreshable braille display.</p>
					<note>
						<p>
              For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary. 
              
            </p>
						<p>
              1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other. This is to give the author some choice at the minimum conformance level, and to provide additional requirements at higher levels. At Level A in Success Criterion 1.2.3, authors do have the choice of providing either an audio description or a full text alternative. If they wish to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3, otherwise an additional requirement. At Level AAA under Success Criterion 1.2.8 they must provide an extended text description. This is an additional requirement if both 1.2.3 and 1.2.5 were met by providing an audio description only. If 1.2.3 was met, however, by providing a text description, and the 1.2.5 requirement for an audio description was met, then 1.2.8 does not add new requirements.</p>

				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by live audio, such as video conferencing, live speeches and radio Webcasts, accessible through the use of a text alternative. A live text caption service will enable live audio to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who cannot otherwise hear the audio. Such services use a trained human operator who listens in to what is being said and uses a special keyboard to enter the text with only a small delay. They are able to capture a live event with a high degree of fidelity, and also to insert notes on any non spoken audio which is essential to understanding the event. A transcript is sometimes a possibility if the live audio is following a set script; but a live caption service is preferred because it plays out at the same pace as the audio itself, and can adapt to any deviations from the script that might occur.</p>
					<p>Using untrained operators, or providing a transcript which differs markedly from what actually happens would not be considered meeting this Success Criterion. </p>
					<p>This success criterion was intended to apply to broadcast of audio and is not intended to require that two-way audio calls between two or more individuals through web apps must be captioned regardless of the needs of users. Responsibility for providing captions would fall to the content providers (the callers) or the “host” caller, and not the application.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 role="examples">
					<head>Examples</head>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p>A public relations firm uses Web based caption services to cover live events; the output from the service is incorporated in a sub frame of the Web page which includes the streaming audio control.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>A live radio play of a fringe theatre group is being broadcast to the Web. As the actors stick largely to a set script, and the budget for the program is small, the producers provide a link (with the playwright's permission) to the script of the play.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>A streaming audio server uses a media format which can also accommodate text and graphics, such as Flash or Silverlight. A stenographer is used to create live captions at an event, and these are mixed on the fly to produce live captions in the media stream which can be viewed by the media player. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>A CEO is to give a press release by telephone to the media in response to a breaking news story, the audio is being recorded and streamed over the internet, but due to time constraints a Web captioning service cannot be set up in time. As the press release is a set statement which the CEO will be reading out, the company simultaneously provides the transcript of the release.</p>

				<head>Intent</head>
				<p>The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that all information is available in a form that can be perceived by all users, for example, spoken aloud, or presented in a simpler visual layout. If all of the information is available in a form that can be determined by software, then it can be presented to users in different ways (visually, audibly, tactilely etc.). If information is embedded in a particular presentation in such a way that the structure and information cannot be programmatically determined by the assistive technology, then it cannot be rendered in other formats as needed by the user. </p>
				<p>The Success Criteria under this guideline all seek to ensure that different types of information that are often encoded in presentation are also available so that they can be presented in other modalities. </p>

				<head>1.3.1</head>
				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that information and relationships that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation format changes. For example, the presentation format changes when the content is read by a screen reader or when a user style sheet is substituted for the style sheet provided by the author.</p>
					<p>
						Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues — headings are often in a larger, bold font separated from paragraphs by blank lines; list items are preceded by a bullet and perhaps indented; paragraphs are separated by a blank line; items that share a common characteristic are organized into tabular rows and columns; form fields may be positioned as groups that share text labels; a different background color may be used to indicate that several items are related to each other; words that have special status are indicated by changing the font family and /or bolding, italicizing, or underlining them; items that share a common characteristic are organized into a table where the relationship of cells sharing the same row or column and the relationship of each cell to its row and/or column header are necessary for understanding; and so on. Having these structures and these relationships programmatically determined or available in text ensures that information important for comprehension will be perceivable to all.
</p>
					<p>Auditory cues may be used as well. For example, a chime might indicate the beginning of a new section; a change in voice pitch or speech rate may be used to emphasize important information or to indicate quoted text; etc.</p>
					<p>
When such relationships are perceivable to one set of users, those relationships can be made to be perceivable to all. One method of determining whether or not information has been properly provided to all users is to access the information serially in different modalities.
          </p>
					<p>If links to glossary items are implemented using anchor elements (or the proper link element for the technology in use) and identified using a different font face, a screen reader user will hear that the item is a link when the glossary term is encountered even though they may not receive information about the change in font face. An on-line catalog may indicate prices using a larger font colored red. A screen reader or person who cannot perceive red, still has the information about the price as long as it is preceded by the currency symbol.</p>
					<p>Some technologies do not provide a means to programmatically determine some types of information and relationships. In that case then there should be a text description of the information and relationships. For instance, "all required fields are marked with an asterisk (*)". The text description should be near the information it is describing (when the page is linearized), such as in the parent element or in the adjacent element.</p>
					<p>There may also be cases where it may be a judgment call as to whether the relationships should be programmatically determined or be presented in text. However, when technologies support programmatic relationships, it is strongly encouraged that information and relationships be programmatically determined rather than described in text.</p>
					<note>
						<p>It is not required that color values be programmatically determined. The information conveyed by color cannot be adequately presented simply by exposing the value. Therefore, <loc href="visual-audio-contrast-without-color" linktype="guideline">Success Criterion 1.4.1
              </loc> addresses the specific case of color, rather than Success Criterion 1.3.1.

							<p>A bus schedule consists of a table with the bus stops listed vertically in the first column and the different buses listed horizontally across the first row. Each cell contains the time when the bus will be at that bus stop. The bus stop and bus cells are identified as headers for their corresponding row or column so that assistive technology can programmatically determine which bus and which bus stop are associated with the time in each cell.

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable a user agent to provide an alternative presentation of content while preserving the reading order needed to understand the meaning. It is important that it be possible to programmatically determine at least one sequence of the content that makes sense. Content that does not meet this Success Criterion may confuse or disorient users when assistive technology reads the content in the wrong order, or when alternate style sheets or other formatting changes are applied.
          </p>
					<p>A sequence is <emph>meaningful</emph> if the order of content in the sequence cannot be changed without affecting its meaning. 
            For example, if a page contains two independent articles, the relative order of the articles may not affect their meaning, as long as they are not interleaved. In such a situation, the articles themselves may have meaningful sequence, but the container that contains the articles may not have a meaningful sequence.</p>
					<p>The semantics of some elements define whether or not their content is a meaningful sequence. For instance, in HTML, text is always a meaningful sequence. Tables and ordered lists are meaningful sequences, but unordered lists are not.</p>
					<p>The order of content in a sequence is not always meaningful. For example, the relative order of the main section of a Web page and a navigation section does not affect their meaning. They could occur in either order in the programmatically determined reading sequence. As another example, a magazine article contains several callout sidebars. The order of the article and the sidebars does not affect their meaning. In these cases there are a number of different reading orders for a Web page that can satisfy the Success Criterion. 
          </p>
					<p>For clarity:</p>
					<olist>
						<item><p>Providing a particular linear order is only required where it affects meaning.</p></item>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access instructions for using the content, even when they cannot perceive shape or size or use information about spatial location or orientation. 
            Some content relies on knowledge of the shape or position of objects that are not available from the structure of the content (for example, "round button" or "button to the right"). 
            Some users with disabilities are not able to perceive shape or position due to the nature of the assistive technologies they use. 
            This Success Criterion requires that additional information be provided to clarify anything that is dependent on this kind of information.
          </p>
					<p>Providing information using shape and/or location, however, is an effective method for many users including those with cognitive limitations.
            This provision should not discourage those types of cues as long as the information is also provided in other ways.
          </p>
					<p>In some languages, it is commonly understood that "above" refers to the content previous to that point in the content and "below" refers to the content after that point. In such languages, if the content being referenced is in the appropriate place in the reading order and the references are unambiguous, statements such as "choose one of the links below" or "all of the above" would conform to this Success Criterion. 
          </p>
					<p>WCAG was designed to apply only to controls that were displayed on a web page. The intent was to avoid describing controls solely via references to visual or auditory cues. When applying this to instructions for operating physical hardware controls (e.g. a web kiosk with dedicated content), tactile cues on the hardware might be described (e.g. the arrow shaped key, the round key on the right side). This success criterion is not intended to prevent the use of tactile cues in instructions.</p>

This example uses both positioning, color and labeling to help identify the icon. </p>

				<p>While some guidelines are focused on making information available in a form that can be presented in alternate formats, this guideline is concerned with making the default presentation as easy to perceive as possible to people with disabilities. The primary focus is on making it easier for users to separate foreground information from the background. For visual presentations this involves making sure that information presented on top of a background contrasts sufficiently with the background. For audio presentations this involves making sure that foreground sounds are sufficiently louder than the background sounds. Individuals with visual and hearing disabilities have much greater difficulty separating foreground and background information.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access information that is conveyed by color differences, that is, by the use of color where each color has a meaning assigned to it. If the information is conveyed through color differences in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.</p>
					<p>Color is an important asset in design of Web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal, its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older users do not see color well. In addition, people using text-only, limited-color or monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented only in color.</p>
					<p>Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields are red", “error is shown in red", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's are in blue". Examples of indications of an action include: using color to indicate that a link will open in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully. An example of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that a required field had been left blank.</p>
					<note>
						<p>This should not in any way discourage the use of color on a page, or even color coding if it is redundant with other visual indication.</p>

The change in color and loss of focus provides redundant, visual information about the state of the control.

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>Individuals who use screen reading software can find it hard to hear the speech output if there is other audio playing at the same time. This difficulty is exacerbated when the screen reader's speech output is software based (as most are today) and is controlled via the same volume control as the sound. Therefore, it is important that the user be able to turn off the background sound. Note: Having control of the volume includes being able to reduce its volume to zero.</p>
					<note>
						<p>Playing audio automatically when landing on a page may affect a screen reader user's ability to find the mechanism to stop it because they navigate by listening and automatically started sounds might interfere with that navigation. Therefore, we discourage the practice of automatically starting sounds (especially if they last more than 3 seconds), and encourage that the sound be <emph>started</emph> by an action initiated by the user after they reach the page, rather than requiring that the sound be <emph>stopped</emph> by an action of the user after they land on the page.</p>

				<head>1.4.3</head>
				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies, hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.</p>
					<p>Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this criterion. 
          </p>
					<p>Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast. The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large Print under <loc href="#visual-audio-contrast-contrast-resources-head">Resources</loc>). "18 point" and "bold" can both have different meanings in different fonts but, except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there are so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding fancy or thin fonts is included.</p>
					<note>
						<p>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities (<abbr expansion="for example">e.g.</abbr> 72 PPI or 96 PPI), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an image editing application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size. When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text. For example, for a 72 PPI image, an author would need to use approximately 19 pt and 24 pt font sizes in order to successfully present images of large-scale text to a user. </p>
					</note>
					<p>The previously-mentioned contrast requirements for text also apply to images of text (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) as stated in Success Criterion 1.4.3.
          </p>
					<p>This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be invisible to all viewers. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are not included in the exception.
          </p>
					<p>In this provision there is an exception that reads "that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content,". This exception is intended to separate pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text in order to get a particular look. </p>
					<note>
						<p>Some people with cognitive disabilities require color combinations or hues that have low contrast, and therefore we allow and encourage authors to provide mechanisms to adjust the foreground and background colors of the content. Some of the combinations that could be chosen may have contrast levels that will be lower than those found in the Success Criteria. This is not a violation of this Success Criteria provided there is a mechanism that will return to the default values set out in the Success Criteria.
            </p>
						<p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate. It is also harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images of text, which is necessary for some users. Therefore, we suggest using text wherever possible, and when not, consider supplying an image of higher resolution.
            </p>
					</note>
					<p>Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for data presented in charts or graphs. Good color contrast should also be provided for data presented in these forms.
          </p>
					<p>See also <specref ref="visual-audio-contrast7"/>.</p>
					<div4>
						<head>Rationale for the Ratios Chosen</head>
						<p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by <bibref
							ref="ISO-9241-3"/> and <bibref ref="ANSI-HFES-100-1988"
							/> for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in this provision to account for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity, congenital or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that typically accompanies aging.</p>
						<p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity loss of roughly 1.5 <bibref
							ref="ARDITI-FAYE"
							/>. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast ratio of 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1.  Following analogous empirical findings and the same logic, the user with 20/80 visual acuity would require contrast of about 7:1.</p>
						<p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses. The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia. (We provide an advisory technique on avoiding red on black for that reason). For more information see <bibref
							ref="ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994"/> <bibref ref="ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1996"
							/> <bibref ref="ARDITI"/>.</p>
						<p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. <bibref
							ref="GITTINGS-FOZARD"/> </p>
						<p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them). The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.</p>
						<note>
							<p>Calculations in <bibref ref="ISO-9241-3"/> and <bibref
								ref="ANSI-HFES-100-1988"
								/> are for body text. A relaxed contrast ratio is provided for text that is much larger.</p>

						<head>Notes on formula</head>
						<p>Conversion from nonlinear to linear RGB values is based on IEC/4WD 61966-2-1 <bibref
							ref="IEC-4WD"
							/> and on "A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet - sRGB" <bibref
							ref="sRGB"/>.</p>
						<p>The formula (L1/L2) for contrast is based on <bibref
							ref="ISO-9241-3"/> and <bibref ref="ANSI-HFES-100-1988"
							/> standards.</p>
						<p>The ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard calls for the contribution from ambient light to be included in the calculation of L1 and L2. The .05 value used is based on Typical Viewing Flare from <bibref
							ref="IEC-4WD"/> and the <bibref ref="sRGB"
							/> paper by M. Stokes et al.</p>
						<p>This Success Criterion and its definitions use the terms "contrast ratio" and "relative luminance" rather than "luminance" to reflect the fact that Web content does not emit light itself. The contrast ratio gives a measure of the relative luminance that would result when displayed. (Because it is a ratio, it is dimensionless.)</p>
						<note>
							<p>
                Refer to <loc href="#visual-audio-contrast-contrast-resources-head">related resources</loc> for a list of tools that utilize the contrast ratio to analyze the contrast of Web content. 
              </p>
							<p>See also <specref ref="navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible"
								/> for techniques for indicating keyboard focus.</p>
							<p>It is sometimes helpful for authors to not specify colors for certain sections of a page in order to help users who need to view content with specific color combinations to view the content in their preferred color scheme. Refer to <specref
								ref="visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation"

								<p>People with low vision often have difficulty reading text that does not contrast with its background. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a minimum luminance contrast ratio between the text and its background can make the text more readable even if the person does not see the full range of colors. It also works for the rare individuals who see no color. </p>

				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that visually rendered text, including text-based controls (text characters that have been displayed so that they can be seen [vs. text characters that are still in data form such as ASCII]) can be scaled successfully so that it can be read directly by people with mild visual disabilities, without requiring the use of assistive technology such as a screen magnifier. Users may benefit from scaling all content on the Web page, but text is most critical. </p>
					<p>The scaling of content is primarily a user agent responsibility. User agents that satisfy <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/guidelines.html#tech-configure-text-scale">UAAG 1.0 Checkpoint 4.1</loc> allow users to configure text scale. The author's responsibility is to create Web content that does not prevent the user agent from scaling the content effectively. Authors may satisfy this Success Criterion by verifying that content does not interfere with user agent support for resizing text, including text-based controls, or by providing direct support for resizing text or changing the layout. An example of direct support might be via server-side script that can be used to assign different style sheets.</p>
					<p>The author cannot rely on the user agent to satisfy this Success Criterion for HTML content if users do not have access to a user agent with zoom support. For example, if they work in an environment that requires them to use IE 6.</p>
					<p>If the author is using a technology whose user agents do not provide zoom support, the author is responsible to provide this type of functionality directly or to provide content that works with the type of functionality provided by the user agent. If the user agent doesn't provide zoom functionality but does let the the user change the text size, the author is responsible for ensuring that the content remains usable when the text is resized. </p>
					<p>Some user interface components that function as a label and require activation by the user to access content are not wide enough to accommodate the label's content. For example, in Web mail applications the subject column may not be wide enough to accommodate every possible subject header, but activating the subject header takes the user to the full message with the full subject header. In Web-based spreadsheets, cell content that is too long to be displayed in a column can be truncated, and the full content of the cell is available to the user when the cell receives focus. The content of a user interface component may also become too wide in user interfaces where the user can resize the column width. In this type of user interface component, line wrapping is not required; truncation is acceptable if the component's full content is available on focus or after user activation and an indication that this information can be accessed, is provided to the user in some way besides the fact that it is truncated.</p>
					<p>Content satisfies the Success Criterion if it can be scaled up to 200%, that is, up to twice the width and height. Authors may support scaling beyond that limit, however, as scaling becomes more extreme, adaptive layouts may introduce usability problems. For example, words may be too wide to fit into the horizontal space available to them, causing them to be truncated; layout constraints may cause text to overlap with other content when it is scaled larger; or only one word of a sentence may fit on each line, causing the sentence to be displayed as a vertical column of text that is difficult to read. </p>
					<p>The working group feels that 200% is a reasonable accommodation that can support a wide range of designs and layouts, and complements older screen magnifiers that provide a minimum magnification of 200%. Above 200%, zoom (which resizes text, images, and layout regions and creates a larger canvas that may require both horizontal and vertical scrolling) may be more effective than text resizing. Assistive technology dedicated to zoom support would usually be used in such a situation and may provide better accessibility than attempts by the author to support the user directly.</p>
					<note>
						<p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate, and therefore we suggest using text wherever possible. It is also harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images of text, which are necessary for some users.

A user with vision impairments increases the text size on a Web page in a browser from 1 em to 1.2 ems. While the user could not read the text at the smaller size, she can read the larger text. All the information on the page is still displayed when the larger font is used for the text.
    </p>

						<item>
							<p>
A Web page contains a control for changing the scale of the page. Selecting different settings changes the layout of the page to use the best design for that scale.
    </p>

A user uses a zoom function in his user agent to change the scale of the content. All the content scales uniformly, and the user agent provides scroll bars, if necessary.

					<head>Intent</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage authors, who are using technologies which are capable of achieving their desired default visual presentation, to enable people who require a particular visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the text presentation as needed. This includes people who require the text in a particular font size, foreground and background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.</p>
					<p>If an author can use text to achieve the same visual effect, he or she should present the information as text rather than using an image. If for any reason, the author cannot format the text to get the same effect, the effect won't be reliably presented on the commonly available user agents, or using a technology to meet this criterion would interfere with meeting other criteria such as 1.4.4, then an image of text can be used. This includes instances where a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed, such as type samples, logotypes, branding, etc. Images of text may also be used in order to use a particular font that is either not widely deployed or which the author doesn't have the right to redistribute, or to ensure that the text would be anti-aliased on all user agents.</p>
					<p>Images of text can also be used where it is possible for users to customize the image of text to match their requirements.</p>
					<p>The definition of image of text contains the note: <quote>Note: This does not include text that is part of a picture that contains significant other visual content.</quote> Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams which visually convey important information through more than just text.</p>
					<p>Techniques for satisfying this Success Criterion are the same as those for Success Criterion 1.4.9, except that they only need to apply if the visual presentation can be achieved with the technologies that the author is using. For Success Criterion 1.4.9, the sufficient techniques would be applied only when the user can customize the output. </p>

				<head>1.4.6</head>
				<div3 role="intent">
					<!--BBC: Note that this is identical to 1.4.3 intent -->
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies, hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.</p>
					<p>Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this criterion. 
          </p>
					<p>Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast. The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large Print under <loc href="#visual-audio-contrast7-resources-head">Resources</loc>). "18 point" and "bold" can both have different meanings in different fonts but, except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there are so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding fancy or thin fonts is included.</p>
					<note>
						<p>When fonts have anti-aliasing applied to make them look smoother, they can lose darkness or lightness.  Thus, the actual contrast can be reduced. Thicker stem widths will reduce this effect (thin fonts could have the full stem lightened rather than just the ends). Using larger fonts and testing for legibility in user agents with font smoothing turned on is recommended.
            </p>
						<p>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities (ex. 72 PPI or 96 PPI), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an image editing application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size. When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text. For example, for a 72 PPI image, an author would need to use approximately 19 pt and 24 pt font sizes in order to successfully present large-scale images of text to a user. </p>
					</note>
					<p>The previously-mentioned contrast requirements for text also apply to
images of text (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) as stated in Success Criterion 1.4.5
            
          </p>
					<p>This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be invisible to all users. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are not included in the exception.
          </p>
					<p>In this provision there is an exception that reads "that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content,". This exception is intended to separate pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text in order to get a particular look. </p>
					<p>Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for data presented in charts or graphs. Good color contrast should also be provided for data presented in these forms.

						<head>Rationale for the Ratios Chosen</head>
						<!-- BBC: Note that next sentence needs to differ slightly from 1.4.3 wrt. "this provision" -->
						<p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by <bibref
							ref="ISO-9241-3"/> and <bibref ref="ANSI-HFES-100-1988"
							/> for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in Success Criterion 1.4.3 to account for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity, congenital or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that typically accompanies aging.</p>
						<p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity loss of roughly 1.5 <bibref
							ref="ARDITI-FAYE"
							/>. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast ratio of 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1.  Following analogous empirical findings and the same logic, the user with 20/80 visual acuity would require contrast of about 7:1.</p>
						<p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses. The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia. (We provide an advisory technique on avoiding red on black for that reason). For more information see <bibref
							ref="ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994"/> <bibref ref="ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1996"
							/> <bibref ref="ARDITI"/>.</p>
						<p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. <bibref
							ref="GITTINGS-FOZARD"/> </p>
						<p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them). The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.</p>
						<note>
							<p>Calculations in <bibref ref="ISO-9241-3"/> and <bibref
								ref="ANSI-HFES-100-1988"
								/> are for body text. A relaxed contrast ratio is provided for text that is much larger.</p>
						</note>
					</div4>
					<div4>
						<head>Notes on formula</head>
						<p>Conversion from nonlinear to linear RGB values is based on IEC/4WD 61966-2-1 <bibref
							ref="IEC-4WD"
							/> and on "A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet - sRGB" <bibref
							ref="sRGB"/>.</p>
						<p>The formula (L1/L2) for contrast is based on <bibref
							ref="ISO-9241-3"/> and <bibref ref="ANSI-HFES-100-1988"
							/> standards.</p>
						<p>The ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard calls for the contribution from ambient light to be included in the calculation of L1 and L2. The .05 value used is based on Typical Viewing Flare from <bibref
							ref="IEC-4WD"/> and the <bibref ref="sRGB"
							/> paper by M. Stokes et al.</p>
						<p>This Success Criterion and its definitions use the terms "contrast ratio" and "relative luminance" rather than "luminance" to reflect the fact that Web content does not emit light itself. The contrast ratio gives a measure of the relative luminance that would result when displayed. (Because it is a ratio, it is dimensionless.)</p>

								<p>People with low vision often have difficulty reading text that does not contrast with its background. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a minimum luminance contrast ratio between the text and its background can make the text more readable even if the person does not see the full range of colors. It also works for the rare individuals who see no color. </p>

				<head>1.4.8</head>
				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that visually  rendered text is presented in such a manner that it can be perceived  without its layout interfering with its readability. People with some  cognitive, language and learning disabilities and some low vision users  cannot perceive the text and/or lose their reading place if the text is presented in a  manner that is difficult for them to read. </p>
					<p>People with some visual or cognitive disabilities need to be  able to select the color of text and the color of the background. They  sometimes choose combinations that seem unintuitive to someone without  that disability. Sometimes these combinations have very low contrast.  Sometimes only very specific color combinations work for them. Control of color or other aspects of text presentation makes a huge difference to their comprehension.  </p>
					<p>For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long  lines of text can become a significant barrier. They have trouble  keeping their place and following the flow of text. Having a narrow  block of text makes it easier for them to continue on to the next line  in a block. Lines should not exceed 80 characters or glyphs (40 if <abbr
						expansion="Chinese, Japanese and Korean">CJK</abbr>), where glyphs are the element of writing in the writing system for the text. Studies have shown that Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) characters are approximately twice as wide as non-CJK characters when both types of characters are displayed with characteristics that achieve the same readability, so the maximum line width for CJK characters is half that of non-CJK characters.</p>
					<p>People with some cognitive disabilities find it difficult to track text where the lines are close together. Providing extra space between lines and paragraphs allows them to better track the next line and to recognize when they have reached the end of a paragraph. It is best if there are several different options, for instance, space-and-a-half and double spacing for line spacing. By space and a half within paragraphs we mean that top of one line is 150% further from the top of the line below it than would be true when the text is 'single spaced' (the default spacing for the font). By Paragraph spacing that is 1.5 times larger than the line spacing we mean that the spacing from the top of the last line of 1 paragraph is 250% farther from the Top of the first line of the next paragraph (i.e., that there is a blank line between the two paragraphs that is 150% of the single space blank line). </p>
					<p>People with certain cognitive disabilities have problems  reading text that is both left and right justified. The uneven spacing  between words in fully justified text can cause "rivers of white" space  to run down the page making reading difficult and in some cases  impossible. Text justification can also cause words to be spaced  closely together, so that it is difficult for them to locate word  boundaries. </p>
					<p>The resizing provision ensures that visually rendered text (text characters that have been displayed so that they can  be seen [vs. text characters that are still in data form such as  ASCII]) can be scaled successfully without requiring  that the user scroll left and right to see all of the content. When the  content has been authored so that this is possible, the content is said  to reflow. This permits people with low vision and people with  cognitive disabilities to increase the size of the text without  becoming disoriented. </p>
					<p>The scaling of content is primarily a user agent  responsibility. User agents that satisfy UAAG 1.0 Checkpoint 4.1 allow  users to configure text scale. The author's responsibility is to create  Web content that does not prevent the user agent from scaling the  content and that allows the reflow of the content within the current  width of the viewport. See <specref
						ref="visual-audio-contrast-scale"
						/> for additional discussion of resizing text. </p>
					<p>The horizontal scrolling requirement is not intended to apply to small-screen devices where long words may be displayed on a single line and require users to scroll horizontally. For the purposes of this requirement, authors should ensure that content meets this requirement on standard desktop/laptop displays with the browser window maximized. Since people generally keep their computers for several years, it is best not to rely on the latest desktop/laptop display resolutions but to consider the common desktop/laptop display resolutions over the course of several years when making this evaluation.</p>
					<p>Wrapping should always be possible as long as words are not so long that a single word is more than half the width of a full screen. Very long <abbr
						expansion="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr> may run off the side of an enlarged screen, but they would not be considered text for "reading" and, therefore, would not violate this provision.</p>
					<p>This provision does not mean that a user would never need to use horizontal scrolling. It only means that they would not need to use horizontal scrolling back and forth to read a line of text. For example, if a page consisted of two equal sized columns of text, it would automatically meet this provision. Enlarging the page would mean that the first column was completely on screen and the user could just scroll vertically down the page to read it. To read the second column, they would horizontally scroll to the right, where the right hand column would then fit entirely within the width of the screen, and read that column without further horizontal scrolling.

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who require a particular visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the text presentation as required. This includes people who require the text in a particular font size, foreground and background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.</p>
					<p>This means implementing the text in a manner that allows its presentation to be changed or providing a mechanism by which users can select an alternate presentation. Using images of text is an example of an implementation that does not allow users to alter the presentation of the text within it.</p>
					<p>In some situations, a particular visual presentation of the text is essential to the information being conveyed. This means that information would be lost without that particular visual presentation. In this case implementing the text in a manner that allows its presentation to be changed is not required. This includes text that demonstrates a particular visual aspect of the text, such as a particular font family, or text that conveys an identity, such as text within a company logo.</p>
					<p>Text that is decorative does not require implementing the text in a manner that allows its presentation to be changed.</p>
					<p>The definition of image of text contains the note: <quote>Note: This does not include text that is part of a picture that contains significant other visual content.</quote> Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams which visually convey important information through more than just text.</p>

								<emph role="bold">A quote</emph>
							</p>
							<p>A Web page contains a quote. The quote itself is presented as italicized text, indented from the left margin. The name of the person to whom the quote is attributed is below the quote with 1.5x the line space and further indented from the left margin. CSS is used to position the text; set the spacing between lines; as well as display the text's font family, size, color and decoration.</p>

								<emph role="bold">Navigation items</emph>
							</p>
							<p>A Web page contains a menu of navigation links that have both an icon and text to describe their target. CSS is used to display the text's font family, size and foreground and background colors; as well as the spacing between the navigation links.</p>
						</item>

								<emph role="bold">A logo containing text</emph>
							</p>
							<p>A Web site contains the organization's logo in the top left corner of each Web page. The logo contains logotype (text as part, or all, of the logo). The visual presentation of the text is essential to the identity of the logo and is included as a gif image which does not allow the text characteristics to be changed. The image has a text alternative.</p>
						</item>
						<item>

							<p>A Web page contains information about a particular font family. Substituting the font family with another font would defeat the purpose of the representation. The representation is included as a jpeg image which does not allow the text characteristics to be changed. The image has a text alternative.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>
								<emph role="bold">A representation of a letter</emph>
							</p>
							<p>A Web page contains a representation of an original letter. The depiction of the letter in its original format is essential to information being conveyed about the time period in which it was written. The letter is included as a gif image which does not allow the text characteristics to be changed. The image has a text alternative.</p>

							<p>A form allows users to enter blocks of text. The form provides a number of buttons, including functions to style the text and check spelling. Some of the buttons use text characters that do not form a sequence that expresses something in human language. For example "B" to increase font weight, "I" to italicize the text and "ABC" to check the spelling. The symbolic text characters are included as gif images which do not allow the text characteristics to be changed. The buttons have text alternatives.</p>

				<head>Intent</head>
				<p>If all <loc href="functiondef" linktype="glossary">functionality</loc> can be achieved using the keyboard, it can be accomplished by keyboard users, by speech input (which creates keyboard input), by mouse (using on-screen keyboards), and by a wide variety of assistive technologies that create simulated keystrokes as their output. No other input form has this flexibility or is universally supported and operable by people with different disabilities, as long as the keyboard input is not time-dependent.</p>
				<p>Note that providing universal keyboard input does not mean that other types of input should not be supported. Optimized speech input, optimized mouse/pointer input, etc., are also good. The key is to provide keyboard input and control as well.</p>
				<p>Some devices do not have native keyboards—for example, a PDA or cell phone. If these devices have a Web browsing capability, however, they will have some means of generating text or "keystrokes". This guideline uses the term "<loc
					linktype="glossary" href="keybrd-interfacedef">keyboard interface</loc>" to acknowledge that Web content should be controlled from keystrokes that may come from a keyboard, keyboard emulator, or other hardware or software that generates keyboard or text input.</p>
			</div2>
			<div2 id="keyboard-operation-advisory" role="gladvisory">
				<head>Advisory techniques for Guideline N.N</head>
			</div2>
			<div2 role="extsrc" id="keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable">
				<head>2.1.1</head>
				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that, wherever possible, content can be operated through a keyboard or keyboard interface (so an alternate keyboard can be used). When content can be operated through a keyboard or alternate keyboard, it is operable by people with no vision (who cannot use devices such as mice that require eye-hand coordination) as well as by people who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators. Keyboard emulators include speech input software, sip-and-puff software, on-screen keyboards, scanning software and a variety of assistive technologies and alternate keyboards. Individuals with low vision also may have trouble tracking a pointer and find the use of software much easier (or only possible) if they can control it from the keyboard.</p>
					<p>Examples of "specific timings for individual keystrokes" include situations where a user would be required to repeat or execute multiple keystrokes within a short period of time or where a key must be held down for an extended period before the keystroke is registered. 
          </p>
					<p>The phrase "except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints" is included to separate those things that cannot reasonably be controlled from a keyboard.</p>
					<p>Most actions carried out by a pointing device can also be done from the keyboard (for example, clicking, selecting, moving, sizing). However, there is a small class of input that is done with a pointing device that cannot be done from the keyboard in any known fashion without requiring an inordinate number of keystrokes. Free hand drawing, watercolor painting, and flying a helicopter through an obstacle course are all examples of functions that require path dependent input. Drawing straight lines, regular geometric shapes, re-sizing windows and dragging objects to a location (when the path to that location is not relevant) do not require path dependent input.
          </p>
					<p>The use of MouseKeys would not satisfy this Success Criterion because it is not a keyboard equivalent to the application; it is a mouse equivalent (i.e., it looks like a mouse to the application).</p>
					<p>It is assumed that the design of user input features takes into account that operating system keyboard accessibility features may be in use. For example, modifier key locking may be turned on. Content continues to function in such an environment, not sending events that would collide with the modifier key lock to produce unexpected results.

				<p>Many users who have disabilities need more time to complete tasks than the majority of users: they may take longer to physically respond, they may take longer to read things, they may have low vision and take longer to find things or to read them, or they may be accessing content through an assistive technology that requires more time. This guideline focuses on ensuring that users are able to complete the tasks required by the content with their own individual response times. The primary approaches deal with eliminating time constraints or providing users enough additional time to allow them to complete their tasks. Exceptions are provided for those cases where this is not possible.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users with disabilities are given adequate time to interact with Web content whenever possible. People with disabilities such as blindness, low vision, dexterity impairments, and cognitive limitations may require more time to read content or to perform functions such as filling out on-line forms. If Web functions are time-dependent, it will be difficult for some users to perform the required action before a time limit occurs. This may render the service inaccessible to them. Designing functions that are not time-dependent will help people with disabilities succeed at completing these functions. Providing options to disable time limits, customize the length of time limits, or request more time before a time limit occurs helps those users who require more time than expected to successfully complete tasks. These options are listed in the order that will be most helpful for the user. Disabling time limits is better than customizing the length of time limits, which is better than requesting more time before a time limit occurs. </p>
					<p>Any process that happens without user initiation after a set time or on a periodic basis is a time limit. This includes partial or full updates of content (for example, page refresh), changes to content, or the expiration of a window of opportunity for a user to react to a request for input. </p>
					<p>	It also includes content that is advancing or updating at a rate beyond the user's ability to read and/or understand it. In other words, animated, moving or scrolling content introduces a time limit on a users ability to read content.</p>
					<p>In some cases, however, it is not possible to change the time limit (for example, for an auction or other real-time event) and exceptions are therefore provided for those cases.</p>

							<p>Timed server redirects can be found below under Common Failures.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Non-timed server redirects (e.g., 3xx response codes) are not applicable because there is no time limit: they work instantly.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>This Success Criterion applies only to time limits that are set by the content itself. For example, if a time limit is included in order to address security concerns, it would be considered to have been set by the content because it  is designed to be part of the presentation and interaction experience for that content. Time limits set externally to content, such as by the user agent or by factors intrinsic to the Internet are not under the author's control and not subject to WCAG conformance requirements. Time limits set by Web servers should be under the author's/organization's control and are covered. (Success Criteria <loc
								linktype="guideline" href="time-limits-no-exceptions">2.2.3</loc>, <loc
								linktype="guideline" href="time-limits-postponed">2.2.4</loc> and <loc linktype="guideline" href="time-limits-server-timeout">2.2.5</loc> may also apply.)</p>

							<p>Ten times the default was chosen based on clinical experience and other guidelines. For example, if 15 seconds is allowed for a user to respond and hit a switch, 150 seconds would be sufficient to allow almost all users to hit a switch even if they had trouble.
              </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>20 seconds was also based on clinical experience and other guidelines. 20 seconds to hit 'any switch' is sufficient for almost all users including those with spasticity. Some would fail, but some would fail all lengths of time. A reasonable period for requesting more time is required since an arbitrarily long time can provide security risks to all users, including those with disabilities, for some applications. For example, with kiosks or terminals that are used for financial transactions, it is quite common for people to walk away without signing off. This leaves them vulnerable to those walking up behind them. Providing a long period of inactivity before asking, and then providing a long period for the person to indicate that they are present can leave terminals open for abuse. If there is no activity the system should ask if the user is there. It should then ask for an indication that a person is there ('hit any key') and then wait long enough for almost anyone to respond. For "hit any key," 20 seconds would meet this. If the person indicates that they are still present, the device should return the user to the exact condition that existed before it asked the question.

							<p>In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a user has to submit a bid.

							<p>An on-line ticket-purchasing site gives the user two minutes to confirm a purchase before the seats are returned to the general pool. Because tickets on such sites can sell out quickly, holding a ticket longer than that may invalidate the nature of the site, so this is a case in which the timing is essential and cannot be extended without invalidating the activity. However, the site does move as much of the process out of the time-critical period as possible, for instance allowing users to provide necessary information like name, payment method, etc., before entering the time-critical stage.

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to avoid distracting users during their interaction with a Web page.</p>
					<p>"Moving, blinking and scrolling" refers to content in which the visible content conveys a sense of motion. Common examples include motion pictures, synchronized media presentations, animations, real-time games, and scrolling stock tickers. "Auto-updating" refers to content that updates or disappears based on a preset time interval. Common time-based content includes audio, automatically updated weather information, news, stock price updates, and auto-advancing presentations and messages. The requirements for moving, blinking and scrolling content and for auto-updating content are the same except that:</p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p>authors have the option of providing the user with a means to control the frequency of updates when content is auto-updating and</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>there is no five second exception for auto-updating since it makes little sense to auto-update for just three seconds and then stop</p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
					<p>Content that moves or auto-updates can be a barrier to anyone who has trouble reading stationary text quickly as well as anyone who has trouble tracking moving objects. It can also cause problems for screen readers.</p>
					<p>Moving content can also be a severe distraction for some people. Certain groups, particularly those with attention deficit disorders, find blinking content distracting, making it difficult for them to concentrate on other parts of the Web page. Five seconds was chosen because it is long enough to get a user's attention, but not so long that a user cannot wait out the distraction if necessary to use the page.</p>
					<p>Content that is paused can either resume in real-time or continue playing from the point in the presentation where the user left off.</p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p>Pausing and resuming where the user left off is best for users who want to pause to read content and works best when the content is not associated with a real-time event or status.</p>
							<note>
								<p>See <specref ref="time-limits-required-behaviors"
									/> for additional requirements related to time-limits for reading.</p>
							</note>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Pausing and jumping to current display (when pause is released) is better for information that is real-time or "status" in nature. For example, weather radar, a stock ticker, a traffic camera, or an auction timer, would present misleading information if a pause caused it to display old information when the content was restarted.</p>
							<note>
								<p>Hiding content would have the same result as pausing and jumping to current display (when pause is released).</p>
							</note>
						</item>
					</olist>
					<p>For a mechanism to be considered "a mechanism for the user to pause," it must provide the user with a means to pause that does not tie up the user or the focus so that the page cannot be used.  The word "pause" here is meant in the sense of a "pause button" although other mechanisms than a button can be used.   Having an animation stop only so long as a user has focus on it (where it restarts as soon as the user moves the focus away) would not be considered a "mechanism for the user to pause" because it makes the page unusable in the process and would not meet this SC.</p>
					<p>It is important to note that the terms "blinking" and "flashing" can sometimes refer to the same content.</p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p>"Blinking" refers to content that causes a distraction problem. Blinking can be allowed for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped)</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>"Flashing" refers to content that can trigger a seizure (if it is more than 3 per second and large and bright enough). This cannot be allowed even for a second or it could cause a seizure. And turning the flash off is also not an option since the seizure could occur faster than most users could turn it off.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Blinking usually does not occur at speeds of 3 per second or more, but it can. If blinking occurs faster than 3 per second, it would also be considered a flash.</p>

Although this is an effective technique for all users with vision, it can be a problem for some users if it persists.

				<head>Intent</head>
				<p>Some people with seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered by flashing visual content. Most people are unaware that they have this disorder until it strikes. In 1997, a cartoon on television in Japan sent over 700 children to the hospital, including about 500 who had seizures<!-- <bibref
					ref="EPFND"
					/>-->. Warnings do not work well because they are often  missed, especially by children who may in fact not be able to read them.</p>
				<!--<ednote>
					<edtext>Previous statement had a reference to an Epilepsy Foundation document but that specific document has been taken down. An alternate reference on their site should be found.</edtext>
				</ednote>-->
				<p>The objective of this guideline is to ensure that content that is marked as conforming to WCAG 2.0 avoids the types of flash that are most likely to cause seizure when viewed even for a second or two.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to access the full content of a site without inducing seizures due to photosensitivity.</p>
					<p>Individuals who have photosensitive seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered by content that flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes. People are even more sensitive to red flashing than to other colors, so a special test is provided for saturated red flashing. These guidelines are based on guidelines for the broadcasting industry as adapted for computer screens, where content is viewed from a closer distance (using a larger angle of vision).</p>
					<p>Flashing can be caused by the display, the computer rendering the image or by the content being rendered. The author has no control of the first two. They can be addressed by the design and speed of the display and computer. The intent of this criterion is to ensure that flicker that violates the flash thresholds is not caused by the content itself. For example, the content could contain a video clip or animated image of a series of strobe flashes, or close-ups of rapid-fire explosions.
          </p>
					<p>This Success Criterion replaces a much more restrictive criterion in WCAG 1.0 that did not allow any flashing (even of a single pixel) within a broad frequency range (3 to 50 Hz). This Success Criterion is based on existing specifications in use in the UK and by others for television broadcast and has been adapted for computer display viewing. The 1024 x 768 screen is used as the reference screen resolution for the evaluation. The 341 x 256 pixel block represents a 10 degree viewport at a typical viewing distance. (The 10 degree field is taken from the original specifications and represents the central vision portion of the eye, where people are most susceptible to photo stimuli.)</p>
					<p>The combined area of flashes occurring concurrently and contiguously means the total area that is actually flashing at the same time. It is calculated by adding up the contiguous area that is flashing simultaneously within any 10 degree angle of view.</p>

								<p>"Blinking" refers to content that causes a distraction problem. Blinking can be allowed for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped)</p>

And turning the flash off is also not an option since the seizure could occur faster than most users could turn it off.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to further reduce the chance of seizures. Seizures cannot be completely eliminated since some people are so sensitive.  However, by eliminating all 3-per-second flashing over any area of the screen, the chances of a person having a seizure are further reduced than when just meeting the measures ordinarily used today in standards internationally, as we do at Level A. 
          </p>
					<p>Whereas <loc href="seizure-does-not-violate" linktype="guideline">Success Criterion 2.3.1</loc> allows flashing if it is dim enough or has a small enough area, Success Criterion 2.3.2 does not allow flashing greater than 3 per second, regardless of brightness or size. As a result, even a single flashing pixel would violate this criterion. The intent is to guard against flashing larger than a single pixel, but since an unknown amount of magnification or high contrast setting may be applied, the prohibition is against any flashing. </p>
					<note>
						<p>In some cases, what we refer to as "blinking" and what we refer to as "flashing" may overlap slightly.  We are using different terms for the two because "blinking" causes a distraction problem which you can allow for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped) whereas "flashing" is a seizure trigger and cannot be allowed or it will cause a seizure. The seizure would occur faster than most users could turn it off.  "Blink" therefore refers to slow repeating changes that would distract.  "Flash" refers to changes that could cause a seizure if they were bright enough or persisted long enough. Blinking usually doesn't occur at speeds of 3 per second or more so blink and flash do not overlap. However, blinking can occur faster than 3 per second so there could be an overlap. See <specref
							ref="time-limits-pause"
							/> for more information on blink.

				<p>The intent of this guideline is to help users find the content they need and allow them to keep track of their location. These tasks are often more difficult for people with disabilities. For finding, navigation, and orientation, it is important that the user can find out what the current location is. For navigation, information about the possible destinations needs to be available. Screen readers convert content to synthetic speech  which, because it is audio, must be presented in linear order.  Some Success Criteria in this guideline explain what provisions need to be taken to ensure that screen reader users can successfully navigate the content. Others allow users to more easily recognize navigation bars and page headers and to bypass this repeated content. Unusual user interface features or behaviors may confuse people with cognitive disabilities.
          
        </p>
				<p>As described in The <loc href="http://www.motive.co.nz/glossary/navigation.php">Motive Web Design Glossary</loc>, navigation has two main functions:</p>
				<ulist>
					<item>
						<p>to tell the user where they are</p>
					</item>
					<item>
						<p>to enable the user to go somewhere else</p>
					</item>
				</ulist>
				<p>This guideline works closely with <loc href="content-structure-separation" linktype="guideline">Guideline 1.3</loc>, which ensures that any structure in the content can be perceived, a key to navigation as well. Headings are particularly important mechanisms for helping users orient themselves within content and navigate through it. Many users of assistive technologies rely on appropriate headings to skim through information and easily locate the different sections of content. Satisfying <loc href="content-structure-separation-programmatic" linktype="guideline">Success Criterion 1.3.1
          </loc> for headings also addresses some aspects of Guideline 2.4.</p>

				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow people who navigate sequentially through content more direct access to the primary content of the Web page. Web pages and applications often have content that appears on other pages or screens. Examples of repeated blocks of content include but are not limited to navigation links, heading graphics, and advertising frames. Small repeated sections such as individual words, phrases or single links are not considered blocks for the purposes of this provision.
            
          </p>
					<p>This is in contrast to a sighted user's ability to ignore the repeated material either by focusing on the center of the screen (where main content usually appears) or a mouse user's ability to select a link with a single mouse click rather than encountering every link or form control that comes before the item they want.</p>
					<p>It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require authors to provide methods that are redundant to functionality provided by the user agent. Most web browsers provide keyboard shortcuts to move the user focus to the top of the page, so if a set of navigation links is provided at the bottom of a web page providing a "skip" link may be unnecessary.</p>
					<note>
						<p>Although this Success Criterion deals with blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages, we also strongly promote structural markup on individual pages as per Success Criteria 1.3.1.
            </p>
					</note>
					<p>Although the success criterion does not specifically use the term “within a set of web pages”, the concept of the pages belonging to a set is implied.  An author would not be expected to avoid any possible duplication of content in any two pages that are not in some way related to each other;  that are not "Web pages that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization” (the definition of set of web pages).</p>
					<note>
						<p>Even for web pages that are not in a set, if a web page has blocks of text that are repeated within the page it may be helpful (but not required) to provide a means to skip over them.</p>

								<p>People who use only the keyboard or a keyboard interface can reach content with fewer keystrokes. Otherwise, they might have to make dozens of keystrokes before reaching a link in the main content area. This can take a long time and may cause severe physical pain for some users.

							<p>A news organization's home page contains a main story in the middle of the page, surrounded by many blocks and sidebars for advertising, searching, and other services. There is a link at the top of the page that jumps to the main story. Without using this link, a keyboard user needs to tab through approximately 40 links to reach the main story; the screen reader user has to listen to 200 words; and the screen magnifier user must search around for the location of the main body.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users find content and orient themselves within it by ensuring that each Web page has a descriptive title. Titles identify the current location without requiring users to read or interpret page content. When titles appear in site maps or lists of search results, users can more quickly identify the content they need. User agents make the title of the page easily available to the user for identifying the page. For instance, a user agent may display the page title in the  window title bar or as the name of the tab containing the page.</p>
					<p>In cases where the page is a document or a web application, the name of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page. Note that it is not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things may also describe the purpose or the topic of the page. </p>
					<p><loc href="navigation-mechanisms-refs" linktype="understanding">Success Criteria 2.4.4</loc> and <loc href="navigation-mechanisms-link" linktype="understanding">2.4.9</loc> deal with the purpose of links, many of which are links to web pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application being linked to would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link. Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on. </p>

				<head>2.4.3</head>
				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that when users navigate sequentially through content, they encounter information in an order that is consistent with the meaning of the content and can be operated from the keyboard. This reduces confusion by letting users form a consistent mental model of the content. There may be different orders that reflect logical relationships in the content. For example, moving through components in a table one row at a time or one column at a time both reflect the logical relationships in the content. Either order may satisfy this Success Criterion.</p>
					<p>The way that sequential navigation order is determined in Web content is defined by the technology of the content. For example, simple HTML defines sequential navigation via the notion of tabbing order. Dynamic HTML may modify the navigation sequence using scripting along with the addition of a tabindex attribute to allow focus to additional elements. If no scripting or tabindex attributes are used, the navigation order is the order that components appear in the content stream. (See HTML 4.01 Specification, section 17.11, "Giving focus to an element").</p>
					<p>An example of keyboard navigation that is not the sequential navigation addressed by this Success Criterion is using arrow key navigation to traverse a tree component. The user can use the up and down arrow keys to move from tree node to tree node. Pressing the right arrow key may expand a node, then using the down arrow key, will move into the newly expanded nodes. This navigation sequence follows the expected sequence for a tree control - as additional items get expanded or collapsed, they are added or removed from the navigation sequence.</p>
					<p>The focus order may not be identical to the programmatically determined reading order (see Success Criterion 1.3.2) as long as the user can still understand and operate the Web page. Since there may be several possible logical reading orders for the content, the focus order may match any of them. However, when the order of a particular presentation differs from the programmatically determined reading order, users of one of these presentations may find it difficult to understand or operate the Web page. Authors should carefully consider all these users as they design their Web pages.</p>
					<p>For example, a screen reader user interacts with the programmatically determined reading order, while a sighted keyboard user interacts with the visual presentation of the Web page. Care should be taken so that the focus order makes sense to both of these sets of users and does not appear to either of them to jump around randomly. </p>
					<p>For clarity:</p>
					<olist>
						<item><p>Focusable components need to receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability only when navigation sequences affect meaning and operability.</p></item>
						<item><p>In those cases where it is required, there may be more than one order that will preserve meaning and operability.</p></item>
						<item><p>If there is more than one order that preserves meaning and operability, only one of them needs to be provided.</p></item>

							<p>A Web page implements modeless dialogs via scripting. When the trigger button is activated, a dialog opens. The interactive elements in the dialog are inserted in the focus order immediately after the button. When the dialog is open, the focus order goes from the button to the elements of the dialog, then to the interactive element following the button. When the dialog is closed, the focus order goes from the button to the following element.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>A Web page implements modal dialogs via scripting. When the trigger button is activated, a dialog opens and focus is set to the first interactive element in the dialog. As long as the dialog is open, focus is limited to the elements of the dialog. When the dialog is dismissed, focus returns to the button or the element following the button.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>An HTML Web page is created with the left hand navigation occurring in the HTML after the main body content, and styled with CSS to appear on the left hand side of the page. This is done to allow focus to move to the main body content first without requiring tabIndex attributes or JavaScript.</p>

								<p>While this example passes the Success Criterion, it is not necessarily true that all CSS positioning would. More complex positioning examples may or may not preserve meaning and operability</p>

							<p>The following example <emph role="bold">fails to meet the Success Criterion</emph>:</p>
							<p>A company's Web site includes a form that collects marketing data and allows users to subscribe to several newsletters published by the company. The section of the form for collecting marketing data includes fields such as name, street address, city, state or province, and postal code. Another section of the form includes several checkboxes so that users can indicate newsletters they want to receive. However, the tab order for the form skips between fields in different sections of the form, so that focus moves from the name field to a checkbox, then to the street address, then to another checkbox.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each link so they can decide whether they want to follow the link. Whenever possible, provide link text that identifies the purpose of the link without needing additional context.
             Assistive technology has the ability to provide users with a list of links that are on the Web page. Link text that is as meaningful as possible will aid users who want to choose from this list of links. Meaningful link text also helps those who wish to tab from link to link. Meaningful links help users choose which links to follow without requiring complicated strategies to understand the page.</p>
					<p>The text of, or associated with, the link is intended to describe the purpose of the link. In cases where the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things may also describe the purpose of the link. </p>
					<p><loc href="navigation-mechanisms-title" linktype="understanding">Success Criterion 2.4.2</loc> deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page. Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on. </p>
					<p>In some situations, authors may want to provide part of the description of the link in logically related text that provides the context for the link. In this case the user should be able to identify the purpose of the link without moving focus from the link. In other words, they can arrive on a link and find out more about it without losing their place. This can be achieved by putting the description of the link in the same sentence, paragraph, list item, the heading immediately preceding the link, or table cell as the link, or in the table header cell for a link in a data table, because these are directly associated with the link itself. </p>
					<p>This context will be most usable if it precedes the link. (For instance, if you must use ambiguous link text, it is better to put it at the end of the sentence that describes its destination, rather than putting the ambiguous phrase at the beginning of the sentence.) If the description follows the link, there can be confusion and difficulty for screen reader users who are reading through the page in order (top to bottom).
          </p>
					<p diff="chg">It is a best practice for links with the same destination to have consistent descriptions (and this is a requirement per <loc linktype="guideline" href="consistent-behavior-consistent-functionality">Success Criterion 3.2.4</loc> for pages in a set). It is also a best practice for links with different purposes and destinations to have different descriptions.</p>
					<p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation, the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made available in the link text or programmatically associated with the link to satisfy the Success Criterion.</p>
					<note>
						<p>There may be situations where the purpose of the link is is supposed to be unknown or obscured. For instance, a game may have links identified only as door #1, door #2, and door #3. This link text would be sufficient because the purpose of the links is to create suspense for all users.</p>

				<head>2.4.9</head>
				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each link in the content, so they can decide whether they want to follow it. Best practice is that links with the same destination would have the same descriptions, but links with different purposes and destinations would have different descriptions (see also <loc href="consistent-behavior-consistent-functionality"
						linktype="guideline">Success Criterion 3.2.4</loc> which calls for consistency in identifying components that have the same functionality). Because the purpose of a link can be identified from its link text, links can be understood when they are out of context, such as when the user agent provides a list of all the links on a page.</p>
					<p>The text in the link is intended to describe the purpose of the link. In cases where the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things may also describe the purpose of the link. </p>
					<p><loc href="navigation-mechanisms-title" linktype="understanding">Success Criterion 2.4.2</loc> deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page. Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on. </p>
					<p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation, the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made available in the link text to satisfy the Success Criterion.</p>
					<p>The word "mechanism" is used to allow authors to either make all links fully understandable out of context by default or to provide a way to make them this way. This is done because for some pages, making the links all unambiguous by themselves makes the pages easier for some users and harder for others. Providing the ability to make the links unambiguous (by them selves) or not provides both users with disabilities with the ability to use the page in the format that best meets their needs.</p>
					<p>For example: A page listing 100 book titles along with links to download the books in HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, MP3, or AAC might ordinarily be viewed as the title of the book as a link with the words "in HTML" after it. then the sentence "Also available in: " followed by a series of short links with text of "HTML", "PDF", "DOC", "TXT", "MP3", and "AAC". At Level 3, some users could opt to view the page this way - because they would find the page harder to understand or slower to use if the full title of the book were included in each of the links. Others could opt to view the page with the full title as part of each of the links so that each link was understandable in itself. Both the former and the latter groups could include people with visual or cognitive disabilities that used different techniques to browse or that had different types or severities of disability.</p>

					<head/>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide headings for sections of a Web page, when the page is organized into sections. For instance, long documents are often divided into a variety of chapters, chapters have subtopics and subtopics are divided into various sections, sections into paragraphs, etc. When such sections exist, they need to have headings that introduce them. This clearly indicates the organization of the content, facilitates navigation within the content, and provides mental "handles" that aid in comprehension of the content. Other page elements may complement headings to improve presentation (e.g., horizontal rules and boxes), but visual presentation is not sufficient to identify document sections.</p>
					<p>This provision is included at Level AAA because it cannot be applied to all types of content and it may not always be possible to insert headings. For example, when posting a pre-existing document to the Web, headings that an author did not include in the original document cannot be inserted. Or, a long letter would often cover different topics, but putting headings into a letter would be very strange. However, if a document can be broken up into sections with headings, it facilitates both understanding and navigation.</p>

				<head>Intent</head>
				<p>The intent of this guideline is to allow text content to be read by users and by assistive technology, and to ensure that information necessary for understanding it is available.</p>
				<p>People with disabilities experience text in many different ways. For some the experience is visual; for some it is auditory; for some it is tactile; for still others it is both visual and auditory. Some users experience great difficulty in recognizing written words yet understand extremely complex and sophisticated documents when the text is read aloud, or when key processes and ideas are illustrated visually or interpreted as sign language. For some users, it is difficult to infer the meaning of a word or phrase from context, especially when the word or phrase is used in an unusual way or has been given a specialized meaning; for these users the ability to read and understand may depend on the availability of specific definitions or the expanded forms of acronyms or abbreviations. User agents, including speech-enabled as well as graphical applications, may be unable to present text correctly unless the language and direction of the text are identified; while these may be minor problems for most users, they can be enormous barriers for users with disabilities. In cases where meaning cannot be determined without pronunciation information (for example, certain Japanese Kanji characters), pronunciation information must be available as well</p>

					<p>
            The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content developers provide information in the Web page that user agents need to present text and other linguistic content correctly. Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately when the language of the Web page is identified. Screen readers can load the correct pronunciation rules. Visual browsers can display characters and scripts correctly. Media players can show captions correctly. As a result, users with disabilities will be better able to understand the content.
          </p>
					<p>The default human language of the Web page is the default text-processing language as discussed in <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-lang/">Internationalization Best Practices: Specifying Language in XHTML &amp; HTML Content</loc>. When a Web page uses several languages, the default text-processing language is the language which is used most. (If several languages are used equally, the first language used should be chosen as the default human language.) 
          </p>
					<note>
						<p>
              For multilingual sites targeting Conformance Level A, the Working Group strongly encourages developers to follow Success Criterion 3.1.2 as well even though that is a Level AA Success Criterion.

				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents can correctly present content written in multiple languages. This makes it possible for user agents and assistive technologies to present content according to the  presentation and pronunciation rules for that language. This applies to graphical browsers as well as screen readers, braille displays, and other voice browsers.</p>
					<p>Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately if the language of each passage of text is identified. Screen readers can use the pronunciation rules of the language of the text. Visual browsers can display characters and scripts in appropriate ways. This is especially important when switching between languages that read from left to right and languages that read from right to left, or when text is rendered in a language that uses a different alphabet. Users with disabilities who know all the languages used in the Web page will be better able to understand the content when each passage is rendered appropriately. </p>
					<p>When no other language has been specified for a phrase or passage of text, its human language is the default human language of the Web page (see Success Criterion 3.1.1). So the human language of all content in single language documents can be programmatically determined. </p>
					<p>Individual words or phrases in one language can become part of another language. For example, "rendezvous" is a French word that has been adopted in English, appears in English dictionaries, and is properly pronounced by English screen readers. Hence a passage of English text may contain the word "rendezvous" without specifying that its human language is French and still satisfy this Success Criterion. Frequently, when the human language of text appears to be changing for a single word, that word has become part of the language of the surrounding text. Because this is so common in some languages, single words should be considered part of the language of the surrounding text unless it is clear that a change in language was intended. If there is doubt whether a change in language is intended, consider whether the word would be pronounced the same (except for accent or intonation) in the language of the immediately surrounding text.
          </p>
					<p>Most professions require frequent use of technical terms which may originate from a foreign language. Such terms are usually not translated to all languages. The universal nature of technical terms also facilitate communication between professionals.</p>
					<p>Some common examples of technical terms include: Homo sapiens, Alpha Centauri, hertz, and habeas corpus.</p>
					<p>Identifying changes in language is important for a number of reasons:
        	</p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p>It allows braille translation software to follow changes in language, e.g., substitute control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to speak the text in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation. If changes are not marked, the synthesizer will try its best to speak the words in the  default language it works in. Thus, the French word for car, "voiture" would be pronounced "voyture" by a speech synthesizer that uses English as its  default language. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Marking changes in language can benefit future developments in technology, for example users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use machines to translate unfamiliar languages.  </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Marking changes in language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using a dictionary. </p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>
            Content should be written as clearly and simply as possible. The intent of this Success Criterion is:</p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p>to ensure that additional content is available to aid the understanding of difficult or complex text;</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>to establish a testable measure indicating when such additional content is required.</p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
					<p>This Success Criterion helps people with reading disabilities while also allowing authors to publish difficult or complex Web content. Text difficulty is described in terms of the level of education required to read the text. Education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education <bibref
						ref="UNESCO"
						/>, which was created to allow international comparison among systems of education. </p>
					<p>Difficult or complex text may be appropriate for most members of the intended audience (that is, most of the people for whom the content has been created). But there are people with disabilities, including reading disabilities, even among highly educated users with specialized knowledge of the subject matter. It may be possible to accommodate these users by making the text more readable. If the text cannot be made more readable, then supplemental content is needed. Supplemental content is required when text demands reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level—that is, more than nine years of school. Such text presents severe obstacles to people with reading disabilities and is considered difficult even for people without disabilities who have completed upper secondary education.</p>
					<p>Reading disabilities such as dyslexia make it difficult to recognize written or printed words and associate them with the correct sounds. This is called "decoding" the text. Decoding must be automatic in order for people to read fluently. The act of decoding text word by word consumes much of the mental energy that most people are able to use for understanding what they read.
             Text that uses short, common words and short sentences is easier to decode and usually requires less advanced reading ability than text that uses long sentences and long or unfamiliar words.</p>
					<p>The education level required to read text content (also called "readability") is measured by analyzing selected passages of text from the Web page. If the Web page includes text written for different purposes or different styles are used, the selected passages include samples of the types of content in the Web page and the different styles in which the content is written. (In many cases, the Web page contains only one kind of text content—e.g., technical documentation, a legal notice, marketing material, etc.—and all the content uses the same style.) </p>
					<p>Educators can also measure the education level required to read text content. For example, qualified teachers can evaluate text according to local education standards to determine if it requires reading ability beyond what is expected for students in the last year of lower secondary education.</p>
					<p>Because people's names, the names of cities or other proper names cannot be changed to shorter names with fewer syllables, and because doing so or just referring to everyone by pronouns can make sentences harder to understand, the success criterion specifies that proper names can be ignored or removed from the text before assessing whether it meets the reading ability requirement. Titles refer to the name of documents, books, movies, etc. Titles are removed or ignored for the analysis because changing the words in titles might make the titles easier to read but would make it impossible to understand the item to which the title refers. This would make it harder to read and understand the content. (e.g., a book, academic paper, article, etc.). Therefore, titles are also exempted specifically. </p>
					<p>When a Web page contains multiple languages, a readability result should be calculated for each language that constitutes at least 5% of the content and that is used in full sentences or paragraphs (not just individual words or phrases). The overall readability of the page should be judged on the language that yields the worst readability results.
          </p>
					<p>The readability of content may also be determined by applying a readability formula to the selected passage. Many (though not all) readability formulas base their calculations on passages of 100 words. Such formulas have been developed for many languages.  The number of words in the passage is counted and the length of the words is determined by counting either the number of syllables or the number of characters. Most readability formulas also count the number and length of sentences. The average length of words and sentences in the content is then used to calculate a readability score.  (Some languages, such as Japanese, may include multiple scripts within the same passage. Readability formulas for these languages may use the number and length of such "runs" in their calculations.)  The result may be presented as a number (for example, on a scale from 0-100) or as a grade level.   These results can then be interpreted using the education levels described in the International Standard Classification of Education. Readability formulas are available for at least some languages when running the spell checkers in popular software if you specify in the options of this engine that you want to have the statistics when it has finished checking your documents.

					<note>
						<p>According to the Open Society Mental Health Initiative, the concept of Easy to Read cannot be universal, and it will not be possible to write a text that will suit the abilities of all people with literacy and comprehension problems. Using the clearest and simplest language appropriate is highly desirable, but the WCAG Working Group could not find a way to test whether this had been achieved. The use of reading level is a way to introduce testability into a Success Criterion that encourages clear writing. Supplementary content can be a powerful technique for people with some classes of cognitive disability.

				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help people who are blind, people who have low vision, and people with reading disabilities to understand content in cases where meaning depends on pronunciation. Often words or characters have different meanings, each with its own pronunciation. The meaning of such words or characters can usually be determined from the context of the sentence. However, for more complex or ambiguous sentences, or for some languages, the meaning of the word cannot be easily determined or determined at all without knowing the pronunciation. When the sentence is read aloud and the screen reader reads the word using the wrong pronunciation, it can be even more difficult to understand than when read visually. When words are ambiguous or indeterminate unless the pronunciation is known, then providing some means of determining the pronunciation is needed.</p>
					<p>
          	For example, in the English language heteronyms are words that are spelled the same but have different pronunciations and meanings, such as the words desert (abandon) and desert (arid region). If the proper pronunciation can be determined from the context of the sentence, then nothing is required.  If it cannot then some mechanism for determining the proper pronunciation would be required. Additionally, in some languages certain characters can be pronounced in different ways. In Japanese, for example, there are characters like Han characters(Kanji) that have multiple pronunciations. Screen readers may speak the characters incorrectly without the information on pronunciation. When read incorrectly, the content will not make sense to users.</p>

							<p>Web content in Japanese provides kana (Japanese phonetic syllabary characters) written next to Han characters (Kanji)  show the pronunciation of a person's name. The kana is provided to users in parentheses right after the word. Giving the reading of the words written in Han characters (Kanji) allows both sighted users and screen readers to read/pronounce the words correctly. Note that screen readers will speak the word twice: the Han characters (Kanji) that can be pronounced in a wrong way are read first and then kana is spoken in order to provide the correct reading.

				<head>Intent</head>
				<p>The intent of this Guideline is to help users with disabilities by presenting content in a predictable order from Web page to Web page and by making the behavior of functional and interactive components predictable. It is difficult for some users to form an overview of the Web page: screen readers present content as a one-dimensional stream of synthetic speech that makes it difficult to understand spatial relationships. Users with cognitive limitations may become confused if components appear in different places on different pages.</p>
				<p>For example, people who use screen magnifiers see only part of the screen at any point in time; a consistent layout makes it easier for them to find navigation bars and other components. Placing repeated components in the same relative order within a set of Web pages allows users with reading disabilities to focus on an area of the screen rather than spending additional time decoding the text of each link. Users with limited use of their hands can more easily determine how to complete their tasks using the fewest keystrokes.</p>

					<p>Focus may be moved to a control either via the keyboard (<abbr expansion="for example">e.g.</abbr> tabbing to a control) or the mouse (<abbr expansion="for example">e.g.</abbr> clicking on a text field). Moving the mouse over a control does not move the focus unless scripting implements this behavior. Note that for some types of controls, clicking on a control may also activate the control (<abbr expansion="for example">e.g.</abbr> button), which may, in turn, initiate a change in context.

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that entering data or selecting a form control has predictable effects. Changing the setting of any user interface component is changing some state in the control that will persist when the user is no longer interacting with it. So checking a checkbox or entering text into a text field changes its setting, but activating a link or a button does not. Changes in context can confuse users who do not easily perceive the change or are easily distracted by changes. Changes of context are appropriate only when it is clear that such a change will happen in response to the user's action.

Along with the standard fields for subject, time and location, there is a set of radio buttons to select the type of calendar entry to create.  The calendar entry type can be meeting, appointment or reminder.  If the user selects the radio for meeting, additional fields are displayed on the page for entering the meeting participants.

                A form contains fields representing US phone numbers. All
of the numbers have a three digit area code followed by a three digit prefix and finally a four digit number, and each part of the phone number is entered into a separate field. When the user completes the entry of one field and enter the first digit of the next field, the focus automatically moves to the next field of the phone number. This behavior of phone fields is described for the user at the beginning of the form.

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage the use of consistent presentation and layout for users who interact with repeated content within 
             a set of Web pages and need to locate specific information or functionality more than once.
            Individuals with low vision who use screen magnification to display a small portion of the screen at a time often use visual cues and page boundaries to quickly locate repeated content.
            Presenting repeated content in the same order is also important for visual users who use spatial memory or visual cues within the design to locate repeated content.
          </p>
					<p>It is important to note that the use of the phrase "same order" in this section is not meant to imply that subnavigation menus cannot be used or that blocks of secondary navigation or page structure cannot be used. Instead, this Success Criterion is intended to assist users who interact with repeated content across Web pages to be able to predict the location of the content they are looking for and find it more quickly when they encounter it again. 
          </p>
					<p>Users may initiate a change in the order by using adaptive user agents or by setting preferences so that the information is presented in a way that is most useful to them.

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure consistent identification of functional components that appear repeatedly within a set of Web pages. A strategy that people who use screen readers use when operating a Web site is to rely heavily on their familiarity with functions that may appear on different Web pages. If identical functions have different labels on different Web pages, the site will be considerably more difficult to use. It may also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for people with cognitive limitations. Therefore, consistent labeling will help. 
          </p>
					<p>This consistency extends to the text alternatives. If icons or other non-text items have the same functionality, then their text alternatives should be consistent as well.</p>
					<p>If there are two components on a web page that both have the same functionality as a component on another page in a set of web pages, then all 3 must be consistent. Hence the two on the same page will be consistent.</p>
					<p>While it is desirable and best practice always to be consistent within a single web page, 3.2.4 only addresses consistency within a set of web pages where something is repeated on more than one page in the set.</p>

						<item>
							<p>
								<emph role="bold">Example 1: Document Icon</emph>
							</p>
							<p>A document icon is used to indicate document download throughout a site. The text alternative for the icon always begins with the word “Download," followed by a shortened form of the document title. Using different text alternatives to identify document names for different documents is a consistent use of text alternatives.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>
								<emph role="bold">Example 2: Check Mark</emph>
							</p>
							<p>A check mark icon functions as "approved", on one page but as "included" on another. Since they serve different functions, they have different text alternatives.
              </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>
								<emph role="bold">Example 3: Consistent references to other pages</emph>
							</p>
							<p> A Web site publishes articles on-line. Each article spans multiple Web pages and each page contains a link to the first page, the next page and the previous page of the article. If the references to the next page read "page 2", "page 3", "page 4" etcetera, the labels are not the same but they are consistent. Therefore, these references are not failures of this Success Criterion. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>
								<emph role="bold">Example 4: Icons with similar functions</emph>
							</p>
							<p>An e-commerce application uses a printer icon that allows the user to print receipts and invoices. In one part of the application, the printer icon is labeled "Print receipt" and is used to print receipts, while in another part it is labeled "Print invoice" and is used to print invoices. The labeling is consistent ("Print x"), but the labels are different to reflect the different functions of the icons. Therefore, this example does not fail the Success Criterion.
                            </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>
								<emph role="bold">Example 5: Save icon</emph>
							</p>
							<p>A common "save" icon is used through out the site where page save function is provided on multiple Web pages.</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>Example 6: Icon and adjacent link to same destination</p>
							<p>An icon with alt text and a link are next to each other and go to the same location. The best practice would be to group them into one link as per <loc href="H2" linktype="html"/>. However if they are visually positioned one above the other but separated in the source, this may not be possible. To meet the Success Criterion, the link text for these two links need only be consistent, not identical. But best practice is to have identical text so that when users encounter the second one, it is clear that it goes to the same place as the first.</p>

								<emph role="bold">Example 7: Example of a Failure</emph>

						<note>
							<p>Text alternatives that are "consistent" are not always "identical." For instance, you may have an graphical arrow at the bottom of a Web page that links to the next Web page. The text alternative may say "Go to page 4." Naturally, it would not be appropriate to repeat this exact text alternative on the next Web page. It would be more appropriate to say "Go to page 5". Although these text alternatives would not be identical, they would be consistent, and therefore would satisfy this Success Criterion.</p>
							<p> A single non-text-content-item may be used to serve different functions. In such cases, different text alternatives are necessary and should be used. Examples can be commonly found with the use of icons such as check marks, cross marks, and traffic signs. Their functions can be different depending on the context of the Web page. A check mark icon may function as "approved", "completed", or "included", to name a few, depending on the situation. Using "check mark" as text alternative across all Web pages does not help users understand the function of the icon. Different text alternatives can be used when the same non-text content serves multiple functions.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage design of Web content that gives users full control of changes of context. 
            This Success Criterion aims to eliminate potential confusion that may be caused by unexpected changes of context such as automatic launching of new windows, automatic submission of forms after selecting an item from a list, etcetera. 
            Such unexpected changes of context may cause difficulties for people with motor impairments, people with low vision, people who are blind, and people with certain cognitive limitations.
          </p>
					<p>Some types of change of context are not disruptive to some users, or actively benefit some users. For example, single-switch users rely on context changes that are animated by the system, and the preferences of low-vision users may vary depending on how much of the content they can see at once and how much of the session structure they can retain in working memory. Some types of content, such as slide shows, require the ability to change context in order to provide the intended user experience. Content that initiates changes of context automatically only when user preferences allow can conform to this Success Criterion.
          </p>

				<head>Intent</head>
				<p>Everyone makes mistakes. However, people with some disabilities have more difficulty creating error-free input. In addition, it may be harder for them to detect that they have made an error. Typical error indication methods may not be obvious to them because of a limited field of view, limited color perception, or use of assistive technology. This guideline seeks to reduce the number of serious or irreversible errors that are made, increase the likelihood that all errors will be noticed by the user, and help users understand what they should do to correct an error.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users are aware that an error has occurred and can determine what is wrong. The error message should be as specific as possible. 
						In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, re-displaying the form and indicating the fields in error is insufficient for some users to perceive that an error has occurred. Screen reader users, for example, will not know there was an error until they encounter one of the indicators. They may abandon the form altogether before encountering the error indicator, thinking that the page simply is not functional. <!--The WCAG 2.0 definition of "input error" says that it is "information provided by the user that is not accepted" by the system. Some examples of information that is not accepted include information that is required but omitted by the user and information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or allowed values.-->Per the definition in WCAG 2.0, an "input error" is information provided by the user that is not accepted. This includes: </p>
					<ulist>
						<item><p>information that is required by the web page but omitted by the user, or</p></item>
						<item><p>information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or allowed values.</p></item>
					</ulist>
					<p>For example:</p>
					<ulist>
						<item><p>the user fails to enter the proper abbreviation in to state, province, region, etc. field; </p></item>
						<item><p>the user enters a state abbreviation that is not a valid state; </p></item>
						<item><p>the user enters a non existent zip or postal code;</p></item>
						<item><p>the user enters a birth date 2 years in the future;</p></item>
						<item><p>the user enters alphabetic characters or parentheses into their phone number field that only accepts numbers;</p></item>
						<item><p>the user enters a bid that is below the previous bid or the minimum bid increment.</p></item>
					</ulist>
					<note><p>If a user enters a value that is too high or too low, and the coding on the page automatically changes that value to fall within the allowed range, the user's error would still need to be described to them as required by the success criterion. Such an error description telling the person of the changed value would meet both this success criterion (Error Identification) and <loc href="minimize-error-suggestions" linktype="understanding">Success Criterion 3.3.3 (Error Suggestion)</loc>. </p></note>
					<p>The identification and description of an error can be combined with programmatic information that user agents or assistive technologies can use to identify an error and provide error information to the user. For example, certain technologies can specify that the user's input must not fall outside a specific range, or that a form field is required. Currently, few technologies support this kind of programmatic information, but the Success Criterion does not require, nor prevent it.
          </p>
					<p>It is perfectly acceptable to indicate the error in other ways such as image, color etc, in addition to the text description.

                An airline Web site offers a special promotion on discounted flights.

If any of the fields of the form are either not completed or completed incorrectly, an alert is displayed notifying the user which field or fields were missing or incorrect.

The single "Phone number" label also cannot label all three fields. To address this, the three fields are grouped in a <code><![CDATA[fieldset]]></code> with the <code><![CDATA[legend]]></code> "Phone number". Visual labels for the fields (beyond the punctuation) cannot be provided in the design, so invisible labels are provided with the "title" attribute to each of the three fields.

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users receive appropriate suggestions for correction of an input error if it is possible. The WCAG 2.0 definition of "input error" says that it is "information provided by the user that is not accepted" by the system. Some examples of information that is not accepted include information that is required but omitted by the user and information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or allowed values.</p>
					<p>Success Criterion 3.3.1 provides for notification of errors. However, persons with cognitive limitations may find it difficult to understand how to correct the errors. People with visual disabilities may not be able to figure out exactly how to correct the error. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, users may abandon the form because they may be unsure of how to correct the error even though they are aware that it has occurred. </p>
					<p>The content author may provide the description of the error, or the user agent may provide the description of the error based on technology-specific, programmatically determined information.

				<div3 role="intent">
					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid serious consequences as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be reversed. For example, purchasing non-refundable airline tickets or submitting an order to purchase stock in a brokerage account are financial transactions with serious consequences. If a user has made a mistake on the date of air travel, he or she could end up with a ticket for the wrong day that cannot be exchanged. If the user made a mistake on the number of stock shares to be purchased, he or she could end up purchasing more stock than intended. Both of these types of mistakes involve transactions that take place immediately and cannot be altered afterwards, and can be very costly. Likewise, it may be an unrecoverable error if users unintentionally modify or delete data stored in a database that they later need to access, such as their entire travel profile in a travel services web site. When referring to modification or deletion of 'user controllable' data, the intent is to prevent mass loss of data such as deleting a file or record. It is not the intent to require a confirmation for each save command or the simple creation or editing of documents, records or other data.</p>
					<p>Users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes. People with reading disabilities may transpose numbers and letters, and those with motor disabilities may hit keys by mistake. Providing the ability to reverse actions allows users to correct a mistake that could result in serious consequences. Providing the ability to review and correct information gives the user an opportunity to detect a mistake before taking an action that has serious consequences.</p>
					<p>User-controllable data is user-viewable data that the user can change and/or delete through an intentional action. Examples of the user controlling such data would be updating the phone number and address for the user's account, or deleting a record of past invoices from a website. It does not refer such things as internet logs and search engine monitoring data that the user can't view or interact with directly. </p>

								<emph>Stock sale:</emph>

							<p>A financial services Web site lets users buy and sell stock online. When a user submits an order to buy or sell stock, the system checks to see whether or not the market is open.

				<p>The purpose of this guideline is to support compatibility with current and future user agents, <emph>especially</emph> assistive technologies (AT). This is done both by 1) ensuring that authors do not do things that would break AT (e.g., poorly formed markup) or circumvent AT (e.g., by using unconventional markup or code) and 2) exposing information in the content in standard ways that assistive technologies can recognize and interact with. Since technologies change quickly, and AT developers have much trouble keeping up with rapidly changing technologies, it is important that content follow conventions and be compatible with APIs so that AT can more easily work with new technologies as they evolve.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents, including assistive technologies, can accurately interpret and parse content. If the content cannot be parsed into a data structure, then different user agents may present it differently or be completely unable to parse it. Some user agents use "repair techniques" to render poorly coded content. 
            
          </p>
					<p>Since repair techniques vary among user agents, authors cannot assume that content will be accurately parsed into a data structure or that it will be rendered correctly by specialized user agents, including assistive technologies, unless the content is created according to the rules defined in the formal grammar for that technology. In markup languages, errors in element and attribute syntax and
failure to provide properly nested start/end tags lead to errors that
prevent user agents from parsing the content reliably.
            Therefore, the Success Criterion requires that the content can be parsed using only the rules of the formal grammar.
          </p>
					<note>
						<p>The concept of "well formed" is close to what is required here. However, exact parsing requirements vary amongst markup languages, and most non XML-based languages do not explicitly define requirements for well formedness. Therefore, it was necessary to be more explicit in the success criterion in order to be generally applicable to markup languages. Because the term "well formed" is only defined in XML, and (because end tags are sometimes optional) valid HTML does not require well formed code, the term is not used in this success criterion.</p>
						<p>With the exception of one success criterion (<specref ref="visual-audio-contrast-scale"/>, which specifically mentions that the effect specified by the success criterion must be achieved without relying on an assistive technology) authors can meet the success criteria with content that assumes use of an assistive technology (or access features in use agents) by the user, where such assistive technologies (or access features in user agents) exist and are available to the user.</p>

					<head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
					<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that Assistive Technologies (AT) can gather information about, activate(or set) and keep up to date on the status of user interface controls in the content.</p>
					<p>When standard controls from accessible technologies are used, this process is straightforward. If the user interface elements are used according to specification the conditions of this provision will be met. (See examples  of Success Criterion 4.1.2 below)</p>
					<p>If custom controls are created, however, or interface elements are programmed (in code or script) to have a different role and/or function than usual, then additional measures need to be taken to ensure that the controls provide important information to assistive technologies and allow themselves to be controlled by assistive technologies.</p>
					<p>A particularly important state of a user interface control is whether or not it has focus. The focus state of a control can be programmatically determined, and notifications about change of focus are sent to user agents and assistive technology. Other examples of user interface control state are whether or not a checkbox or radio button has been selected, or whether or not a collapsible tree or list node is expanded or collapsed.</p>
					<note>
						<p>Success Criterion 4.1.2 requires a programmatically determinable name for all user interface components. Names may be visible or invisible. Occasionally, the name must be visible, in which case it is identified as a label. Refer to the definition of name and label in the glossary for more information.</p>

				<head>Conformance</head>
				<p>All WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria are written as testable criteria for objectively determining if content satisfies them. Testing the Success Criteria would involve a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. The content should be tested by those who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the Web.</p>
				<p>Testing and testable in the context refer to functional testing, that is verifying that the content functions as expected, or in this case, that it satisfies the Success Criteria. Although content may satisfy all Success Criteria, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. Therefore, usability testing is recommended, in addition to the required functional testing. Usability testing aims to determine how well people can use the content for its intended purpose. It is recommended that users with disabilities be included in test groups when performing usability testing.</p>
				<div3 role="normal" id="conformance-whatis">
					<head>What does conformance mean?</head>
					<p>Conformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the 'requirements' of the standard. In WCAG 2.0 the 'requirements' are the Success Criteria. To conform to WCAG 2.0, you need to satisfy the Success Criteria, that is, there is no content which violates the Success Criteria. </p>
					<note>
						<p>This means that if there is no content to which a success criterion applies, the success criterion is satisfied.</p>
					</note>
					<p>Most standards only have one level of conformance. In order to accommodate different situations that may require or allow greater levels of accessibility than others, WCAG 2.0 has three levels of conformance, and therefore, three levels of Success Criteria.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 role="normal" id="conformance-requirements">
					<head>Understanding Conformance Requirements</head>
					<p>There are five requirements that must be met in order for content to be classified as 'conforming' to WCAG 2.0. This section provides brief notes on those requirements. This section will be expanded over time to address questions that may arise or to provide new examples of ways to meet the different conformance requirements.</p>
					<div4 id="conf-req1">
						<head>Understanding Requirement 1</head>
						<p role="ccextsrc" id="cc1"/>
						<p>The first requirement deals with the levels of conformance. It basically says that all information on a page conforms or has a <loc href="conforming-alternate-versiondef" linktype="glossary">conforming alternate version</loc> that is available from the page. The requirement also explains that no conformance is possible without at least satisfying all of the Level A Success Criteria. </p>
						<p>The note points out that authors are encouraged to go beyond conformance to a particular level and to complete, and report if they desire, any progress toward higher levels of conformance.</p>
						<p>See also <loc href="#uc-conforming-alt-versions-head">Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions</loc> which includes techniques for providing Conforming Alternate Versions.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 id="conf-req2">
						<head>Understanding Requirement 2</head>
						<p role="ccextsrc" id="cc2"/>
						<p>This provision simply requires that the whole page conform. Statements about "part of a page conforming" cannot be made.
            </p>
						<p>Sometimes, supplemental information may be available from another page for information on a page. The <code><![CDATA[longdesc]]></code> attribute in HTML is an example. With <code><![CDATA[longdesc]]></code>, a long description of a graphic might be on a separate page that the user can jump to from the page with the graphic. This makes it clear that such content is considered part of the Web page, so that requirement #2 is satisfied for the combined set of Web pages considered as a single Web page. Alternatives can also be provided on the same page. For example creating an equivalent to a user interface control.
            </p>
						<note>
							<p>Because of conformance requirement 5, a whole page may conform even if parts of the page use non accessibility-supported content technologies as long as they do not interfere with the rest of the page and all information and function is available elsewhere on or from the page.</p>
							<p>It is possible to include non-conforming content. See <loc href="conformance" locn-note="uc-conf-req5-head"
								linktype="understanding">Understanding Conformance Requirement 5</loc>.</p>
						</note>
					</div4>
					<div4 id="conf-req3">
						<head>Understanding Requirement 3</head>
						<p role="ccextsrc" id="cc3"/>
						<p>This provision prevents a Web page that is part of a larger process from being considered conforming if the process overall is not. This would prevent a shopping site from being classified as conforming if the checkout or other features of the site that are part of the shopping and buying process do not conform.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 id="conf-req4">
						<head>Understanding Requirement 4</head>
						<p role="ccextsrc" id="cc4"/>
						<p>This conformance requirement is explained below under <loc href="conformance" locn-note="uc-accessibility-support-head"
							linktype="understanding">Understanding Accessibility Support</loc>.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 id="conf-req5">
						<head>Understanding Requirement 5</head>
						<p role="ccextsrc" id="cc5"/>
						<p>This basically says that technologies that are <emph role="bold">not accessibility supported</emph> can be used, as long as all the information is also available using technologies that <emph
							role="bold">are accessibility supported</emph> and as long as the <emph
							role="bold">non-accessibility-supported</emph> material does not interfere.</p>
						<p>Technologies that are not accessibility supported can be used, or technologies that are accessibility supported can be used in a non conforming manner, as long as all the information is also available using technologies that are accessibility supported, in a manner that does conform, and as long as the non-accessibility-supported material does not interfere.</p>
						<p>There are four provisions that particularly deal with issues of interference with use of the page. These four are included in a note here. A note on each of the provisions indicates that these Success Criteria need to be met for all content including content created using technologies that are not accessibility supported.</p>
						<example>
							<p>A Web page incorporates a new interactive graphic technology called "ZAP". Although ZAP is accessibility-supported, the information that is presented in ZAP is also presented on the page in HTML, so ZAP is not relied upon. So, this page would pass conformance requirement #1.  However, if the user tries to tab through the ZAP content, the focus drops into the ZAP object and gets stuck there.  Once inside, there is nothing the user can do to get the focus back out.  So keyboard users cannot use the bottom half of the page. The ZAP content also is continually flashing brightly at different rates and doesn't stop.   So, people with attention deficit are distracted and those with photosensitive seizure disorders may have seizures.  Conformance requirement #5 prevents situations like these from being possible on a conforming page. </p>
						</example>
					</div4>
				</div3>
				<div3 role="normal" id="conformance-claims">
					<head>Understanding Conformance Claims</head>
					<p>It is not required to make any conformance claim in order to conform. If one does make a claim, however, the rules must be followed.</p>
					<p>Sometimes, one may want to make a claim for just the content that was added after a certain date. Or, one may want to claim WCAG 1.0 conformance for content up to a date and WCAG 2.0 for content that was created or modified after that date. There are no prohibitions in WCAG 2.0 to any of these practices as long as it is clear which pages are claiming conformance to which version of WCAG.</p>
					<note>
						<p>When talking about technologies that are "relied upon," we're talking about Web content technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), not user agents (browsers, assistive technologies, etc.).</p>
						<p>Conformance claims are not usually located on each Web page within the scope of conformance.</p>
					</note>
					<div4>
						<head>Information about any additional steps taken that go beyond the Success Criteria</head>
						<p>One of the optional components of a conformance claim is "Information about any additional steps taken that go beyond the Success Criteria to enhance accessibility." This can include additional Success Criteria that have been met, advisory techniques that were implemented, information about any additional protocols used to aid access for people with particular disabilities or needs, etc. Any information that would be useful to people in understanding the accessibility of the pages may be included.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 id="meta-claims">
						<head>Use of metadata to report conformance claims</head>
						<p>The most useful way of attaching conformance claims to content would be to do so in standard machine readable form. When this practice is widespread, search tools or special user agents will be able to make use of this information to find and provide content that is more accessible or so the user agents can adjust to the content. There are a number of metadata based options under development for making claims, and authors and tool developers are encouraged to support them.</p>
						<p>In addition, metadata can be used to report conformance to individual Success Criteria once Level A conformance has been achieved.</p>
						<p>There are also programmatic reporting formats such as <loc href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/earl.php">Evaluation and Report Language (EARL)</loc> that are being developed that could provide machine readable formats for detailed conformance information. As the reporting formats are formalized and support for them develops, they will be documented here.</p>

					<p>First, there are a number of conditions that must be met for a Success Criterion to be included at all. These include:</p>
					<olist>
						<item>
							<p>All Success Criteria must be <emph role="bold">important access issues for people with disabilities</emph> that address problems beyond the usability problems that might be faced by all users. In other words, the access issue must cause a proportionately greater problem for people with disabilities than it causes people without disabilities in order to be considered an accessibility issue (and covered under these accessibility guidelines).</p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p>All Success Criteria must also be testable. This is important since otherwise it would not be possible to determine whether a page met or failed to meet the Success Criteria. The Success Criteria can be tested by a combination of machine and human evaluation as long as it is possible to determine whether a Success Criterion has been satisfied with a high level of confidence.</p>
						</item>
					</olist>
					<p>The Success Criteria were assigned to one of the three levels of conformance by the working group after taking into consideration a wide range of interacting issues. Some of the common factors evaluated when setting the level included:</p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p>whether the Success Criterion is <emph role="bold">essential</emph> (in other words, if the Success Criterion isn't met, then even assistive technology can't make content accessible)</p>
						</item>

					<head>Understanding Accessibility Support</head>
					<p>Many of the Success Criteria deal with providing accessibility through assistive technologies or special accessibility features in mainstream user agents (for example, a 'show captions' option in a media player). That is, the Success Criteria require that something be done in the Web content that would make it possible for assistive technologies to successfully present the content's information to the user. For example, a picture that you were supposed to click on to go to a topic would not be accessible to a person who was blind unless text alternatives for the picture were provided in a way that user agents including assistive technologies can find and display them. The key here is that the text alternative must be included in a way that user agents including assistive technologies can understand and use – in a way that is "Accessibility Supported."</p>
					<p>Another example would be a custom control that is included on a Web page. In this case, a standard user agent would not ordinarily be able to present an alternative to the user. If, however, information about the control including its name, role, value, how to set it etc. are provided in a way that assistive technologies can understand and control them, then users with assistive technologies will be able to use these controls.</p>
					<p>When new technologies are introduced, two things must happen in order for people using assistive technologies to be able to access them. First, the technologies must be designed in a way that user agents including assistive technologies could access all the information they need to present the content to the user. Secondly, the user agents and assistive technologies may need to be redesigned or modified to be able to actually work with these new technologies.</p>
					<p>"<emph role="bold">Accessibility Supported</emph>" means that both of these have been done and that the technology will work with user agents and assistive technologies.</p>

						<head>Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"</head>
						<p>This topic raises the question of how many or which assistive technologies must support a Web technology in order for that Web technology to be considered "accessibility supported". The WCAG Working group and the W3C do not specify which or how many assistive technologies must support a Web technology in order for it to be classified as accessibility supported. This is a complex topic and one that varies both by environment and by language. There is a need for an external and international dialogue on this topic. Some notes to help in understanding and exploring this topic are:</p>
						<olist>
							<item>
								<p>Accessibility support of Web technologies varies by environment</p>
								<ulist>
									<item>
										<p>Web technologies may only need to be supported by those specific user agents and assistive technologies deployed at a company. (These may be older versions of user agents and assistive technologies or the very newest versions).</p>
									</item>
									<item>
										<p>Content posted to the public Web may need to work with a broader range of user agents and assistive technologies, including older versions.</p>
									</item>
								</ulist>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>Accessibility support of Web technologies varies by language (and dialect)</p>
								<ulist>
									<item>
										<p>There are different levels of older assistive technologies support in different languages and even countries. Some environments or countries may provide free assistive technologies.</p>
									</item>
								</ulist>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>New technologies won't be supported in older assistive technologies</p>
								<ulist>
									<item>
										<p>Clearly, a new technology cannot be supported by all past assistive technologies, so requiring that a technology be supported by all assistive technologies is not possible.</p>
									</item>
								</ulist>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>Support for a single older assistive technology is usually not sufficient</p>
								<ulist>
									<item>
										<p>Support by just one assistive technology (for a given disability) would not usually be enough, especially if most users who need it in order to access content do not have and cannot afford that assistive technology. The exception here would be information distributed to company employees only where they all have one assistive technology (of that type).</p>
									</item>
								</ulist>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>Currently assistive technology that is affordable by the general public is often very poor</p>
								<ulist>
									<item>
										<p>Creating content that can't be used by the general public with disabilities should be avoided. In many cases, the cost of assistive technologies is too high for users who need it. Also, the capabilities of free or low cost AT is often so poor today that Web content cannot be realistically restricted to this lowest (or even middle) common denominator. This creates a very difficult dilemma that needs to be addressed.</p>
									</item>
								</ulist>
							</item>
						</olist>
						<p>The Working Group, therefore, limited itself to defining what constituted support and defers the judgment of how much, how many, or which AT must support a technology to the community and to entities closer to each situation that set requirements for an organization, purchase, community, etc.</p>
						<p>The Working Group encourages more discussion of this topic in the general forum of society since this lack of generally available yet robust assistive technologies is a problem that affects users, technology developers and authors negatively.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 role="normal" id="accessibility-supported-definition">
						<head>Technical Definition of "Accessibility Support"</head>
						<p>Basically, a Web content technology is "accessibility supported" when users' assistive technologies will work with the Web technologies <emph
							role="bold">AND</emph> when the accessibility features of mainstream technologies will work with the technology. Specifically, to qualify as an accessibility-supported technology, the following must be true for a technology:</p>
						<p id="copyaccessibility-supporteddef"/>
					</div4>
					<div4 role="normal" id="documented-lists">
						<head>Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses</head>
						<p>Individual authors will not usually be able to do all of the testing necessary to determine which ways of using which Web technologies are actually supported by which versions of assistive technologies and user agents. Authors may therefore rely on publicly documented compilations that document which assistive technologies support which ways of using which Web technologies. By public, we do not mean that the compilation and its documentation are necessarily generated by a public agency, only that they are available to the public. Anyone can create publicly documented compilations of "Web Technology Uses and their Accessibility Support." People may create compilations and give them names that authors can refer to them by. As long as they are publicly documented, authors or customers etc. can easily select uses that meet their needs. Customers or others can pick technologies that fit their environment or language at any point in time and specify those to be used in creating their content. Authors are strongly encouraged to use sources that have an established reputation for accuracy and usefulness. Technology developers are strongly encouraged to provide information about the accessibility support for their technologies. The Working Group anticipates that only documents that provide accurate information and benefit both authors and users will achieve market recognition in the long term.</p>
						<p>There is no requirement in WCAG that a publicly documented compilation be used or that only technology uses from such a compilation be used. The publicly documented compilations are described only as a method to make an otherwise critical, but somewhat complicated, aspect of conformance easier for authors who are not themselves experts on assistive technology support (or who just don't have the time to keep up with advances in mainstream and assistive technology support for each other).</p>
						<p>Authors, companies or others may wish to create and use their own compilations of accessibility-supported technology uses and this is allowed in meeting WCAG. Customers, companies or others may, however, specify that technology uses from a custom or public compilation be used. See <specref

				<div3 role="normal" id="programmatically-determined">
					<head>Understanding "Programmatically Determined"</head>
					<p>Several Success Criteria require that content (or certain aspects of content) can be "programmatically determined." This means that the content is authored in such a way that user agents, including assistive technologies, can access the information.</p>
					<p>In order for content created with Web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, PDF, GIF, MPEG, Flash etc.) to be accessible to people with different types of disabilities, it is essential that the technologies used work with the accessibility features of browsers and other user agents, including assistive technologies. In order for something to meet a Success Criterion that requires it to be "programmatically determined," it would need to be implemented using a technology that has assistive technology support.</p>
					<p>Content that can be "programmatically determined" can be transformed (by user agents including AT) into different sensory formats (e.g., visual, auditory) or styles of presentation need by individual users. If existing assistive technologies cannot do this, then the information cannot be said to be programmatically determined.</p>
					<p>The term was created in order to allow the working group to clearly identify those places where information had to be accessible to assistive technologies (and other user agents acting as accessibility aids) without specifying exactly how this needed to be done. This is important because of the continually changing nature of the technologies. The term allows the guidelines to identify what needs to be "programmatically determined" in order to meet the guidelines, and then have separate documents (the How to Meet, Understanding, and Technique documents), which can be updated over time, list the specific techniques that will work and be sufficient at any point in time based on user agent and assistive technology support.</p>
					<div4 id="ASvsPD">
						<head>"Accessibility Supported" vs. "Programmatically Determined"</head>
						<p>"Accessibility supported" relates to support by user agents (including assistive technologies) of particular ways of using Web technologies. Uses of Web technologies that are accessibility supported will work with assistive technologies and access features in mainstream user agents (browsers and players etc.).</p>
						<p>"Programmatically determined" relates to the information in Web Content. If technologies that are accessibility supported are used properly, then assistive technologies and user agents can access the information in the content (i.e., programmatically determine the information in the content) and present it to the user.</p>
						<p>The two concepts work together to ensure that information can be presented to the user by user agents including assistive technologies. Authors must rely only on uses of technologies that are accessibility-supported — and must use them properly in order for the information to be programmatically determinable — and hence presentable, by assistive technologies and user agents to users with disabilities.</p>

					<head>Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions</head>
					<p>Conformance requirement #1 allows non-conforming pages to be included within the scope of conformance as long as they have a "conforming alternate version". The conforming alternative version is defined as:</p>
					<p id="copyconforming-alternate-versiondef"/>
					<p>This ensures that all of the information and all of the functionality that is on the pages inside of the scope of conformance is available on conforming Web pages.</p>
					<div4 id="whypermit">
						<head>Why permit alternate versions?</head>
						<p>Why does WCAG permit conforming alternate versions of Web pages to be included in conformance claims? That is, why include pages that do not satisfy the Success Criteria for a conformance level in the scope of conformance or a claim?</p>
						<ulist>
							<item>
								<p>Sometimes, pages use technologies that are not yet accessibility supported. When a new technology emerges, assistive technology support may lag behind, or may only be available to some target audiences. So authors may not be able to rely on the new technology for all users. However, there may be other benefits to using the new technology, e.g., better performance, a wider range of modalities available, etc. The alternate version requirement allows authors to include such Web pages in their Web site by providing an accessible alternative page in technologies that are accessibility supported. Users for whom the new technology is adequately supported get the benefits of the new version. Authors who look ahead to future accessibility support can satisfy the Success Criteria now with the alternate version page, and also work with the other page to build in future access when assistive technology (AT) support is available.</p>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>For a variety of reasons, it may not be possible to modify some content on a Web page. For instance,</p>
								<ulist>
									<item>
										<p>It may be critical to include an exact visual copy of a document for legal or historical reasons</p>
									</item>
									<item>
										<p>The Web page may be included in a site but the site owner may not have the legal rights to modify the content on the original page</p>
									</item>
									<item>
										<p>The company may not legally be able to remove, or alter in any way, something that was previously posted.</p>
									</item>
									<item>
										<p>An author may not have permission to alter a document from another department, agency, or company</p>
									</item>
								</ulist>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>Sometimes, the best experience for users with certain types of disabilities is provided by tailoring a Web page specifically to accommodate that disability. In such a situation, it may not be possible or practical to make the Web page accommodate all disabilities by satisfying all of the Success Criteria. The alternate versions requirement permits such specialized pages to be included within a conformance claim as long as there is a fully conformant 'alternate version' page.</p>
							</item>
							<item>
								<p>Many sites which are committed to accessibility have large quantities of legacy documents. While the information has been made available in accessible formats, there would be significant institutional resistance and procedural obstacles to removing these files en mass. Some organizations, especially governmental bodies, give precedence to traditional print-oriented processes. Even as these organizations have adapted to Internet publishing and embraced the need for accessible formats, they still retain a paper mindset and often insist on formats designed for hard copy as the "primary" version (even for documents that are only ever "published" electronically). Although the Working Group feels these approaches should be deprecated it does not feel they can be forbidden so long as accessible versions are readily available.</p>
							</item>
						</ulist>
						<p>A concern when permitting Web pages that do not satisfy the Success Criteria is that people with disabilities will encounter these non-conforming pages, not be able to access their content, and not be able to find the “conforming alternate version." A key part of the Alternate Versions provision, therefore, is the ability to find the conforming page (the alternate version) from the non-conforming page when it is encountered. The conformance requirement that permits alternate pages, therefore, also requires a way for users to find the accessible version among the alternate versions.</p>
						<p>Note that providing an alternate version is a fallback option for conformance to WCAG and the preferred method of conformance is to make all content directly accessible.</p>
					</div4>
					<div4 id="techsaltver">
						<head>Techniques for Providing a Conforming Alternate Version</head>
						<p>The most important part of providing a conforming alternate version is providing a mechanism to find it from the non-conforming version. A number of different methods for doing this have been identified since particular techniques may not always be possible for specific technologies or situations. For example, if the author has control of the server there are some powerful techniques that will allow users to always have the choice up front. In many cases however the author may not have control of the services on their Web server. In these cases other techniques are provided. A link on the non-conforming page is another powerful technique but not all non-conforming technologies support hypertext links.</p>
						<p>Below are the techniques that have been identified to date. We expect that additional techniques will also be developed over time and they will be added here as they arise and the support for these approaches by user agents including assistive technologies can be demonstrated. For example a developer of a new technology that some assistive technologies cannot access might build in a feature that would allow those technologies to automatically present a link to users that could take them to an alternate version.</p>

					<head>Understanding "Web Page"</head>
					<p>The definition of a Web Page is:</p>
					<p id="copywebpagedef"/>
					<p>It is important to note that, in this standard, the term "Web page" includes much more than static HTML pages. The term 'Web Page' was used in these guidelines to allow the guidelines to be more understandable. But the term has grown in meaning with advancing technologies to encompass a wide range of technologies, many of which are not at all 'page-like'. It also includes the increasingly dynamic Web pages that are emerging on the Web, including "pages" that can present entire virtual interactive communities. For example, the term "Web page" would include an immersive interactive movie-like experience that you find at a single URI.</p>
				</div3>
				<div3 role="normal" id="text-alternatives">
					<head>Understanding "Text Alternatives"</head>
					<p>A text alternative is text that is used in place of non-text content for those who cannot view the non-text content. Non-text content includes  such things as pictures, charts, applets, audio files, etc. People who cannot see for example would not be able to see information presented in a picture or chart. A text alternative is therefore provided that allows the user to be able to convert the information (the text) into speech. In the future, having the information in text also makes it possible to translate the information into sign language, into pictures, or into a simpler form of writing.</p>
					<p> In order for people with disabilities to be able to use this text - the text must be "programmatically determinable."  This means that the text must be able to be read and used by the assistive technologies (and the accessibility features in browsers) that people with disabilities use.</p>
					<p>It must also be possible for people using assistive technologies to find these text alternatives when they encounter non-text content that they cannot use. To accomplish this, we say that the text must be "programmatically associated" with the non-text content.  This means that the user must be able to use their assistive technology to find the alternative text (that they can use) when they land on the non-text content (that they can't use).</p>

			<head>Documenting Accessibility Support for Uses of a Web Technology</head>
			<p>The documentation of accessibility support for uses of a Web technology  provides the information needed to determine whether it is possible to  satisfy the WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria for a particular environment. </p>
			<p>Accessibility Support documentation for uses of a Web technology includes the following information: </p>
			<ulist>
				<item>
					<p> The version or versions of the technology </p>
				</item>
				<item>
					<p> For each user agent or plug-in that supports this version of the technology:</p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p> The version of the user agent or plug-in, including the operating system or platform </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Ways of using the technology that are supported by the user agent; ideally, there are ways to meet all of the success criteria, but exceptions should be noted. </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Known limitations of the user agent support for uses of the technology to meet Success Criteria
							</p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
				</item>
				<item>
					<p> For each assistive technology that supports the Web technology:</p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p> The version of the assistive technology, including the operating system or platform </p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
				</item>
				<item>
					<p> For each host user agent that is supported by this version of the assistive technology:</p>
					<ulist>
						<item>
							<p> Ways of using the technology supported by the assistive technology for this user agent </p>
						</item>
						<item>
							<p> Known limitations in the support of uses of the technology to meet success criteria when using the assistive technology with this user agent </p>
						</item>
					</ulist>
				</item>
			</ulist>
			<p>Target environments are defined by the user agents and assistive technologies available to its users. Documentation of accessibility support involves detailed understanding of the ways to use functionality of a  technology to meet success criteria, and also of user agents and assistive technology. Because of this, vendors and developers of Web technologies and user agents are encouraged to provide this information about the accessibility  support of their products. Similarly, developers and vendors of  assistive technology are encouraged to provide this information about  the ways to use Web technologies  that are supported by their products. Authors should need to document the accessibility supported ways to use a technology only  when there is not reliable documentation available from vendors or  testing groups for those uses. </p>
			<p>For a controlled environment, such as a corporate workplace,  the user agents and assistive technologies available may be a specific  set of versions of user agents on a specific set of platforms. To  determine whether uses of a Web technology are accessibility supported in a  target environment, an author checks that the user agents and assistive  technologies available are in the set of supported user agents and assistive technologies listed for those uses in the Accessibility Support  documentation. </p>
			<p>For a target environment like the Internet, authors may need  to consider a much larger set of user agents, including older versions,  and on a wider variety of platforms. </p>
			<p>Environments that use different natural languages are different target environments. For example, the accessibility-supported ways of using technologies for an English language environment may differ from those  for an Arabic language environment, since there may be different user agents and assistive technologies that support these languages.</p>
			<p>The documentation includes version-specific information about all the assistive technologies and all the user agents and the ways  that they interact with one another. If support in these user agents is  similar, it will be straightforward for an author to decide if a documented way of using a technology is accessibility supported. If the uses supported are different in different versions, authors can only rely on the uses that are supported in the versions available to their users in  determining accessibility support. </p>
			<p>If a way of using a technology is not relied upon for conformance, the absence of accessibility support for that use does not prevent conformance of the Web page. So if the unsupported use does not occur in the content, or if there is a conforming version of that content available, the Web page still conforms. For instance, lack of accessibility support for interactive controls in a Web technology would not prevent uses of the Web technology for non-interactive content that are accessibility supported. </p>

			<head>Understanding Metadata</head>
			<p>This section discusses metadata techniques that can be employed to  satisfy WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria. For more information about metadata  see resources below. </p>
			<p>At its most basic level, metadata is essentially 'data about data' and is used to both describe and find resources. </p>
			<p>Metadata is a powerful tool that can be used for describing Web  pages and accessible components of Web pages as well as associating  alternate versions of Web content to each other. These descriptions in  turn allows users to locate specific information they need or prefer. </p>
			<p>In conjunction with WCAG, metadata can play a number of roles including: </p>
			<olist>
				<item>
					<p> Metadata can be used to associate conforming alternate  versions of Web pages with Web pages which do not conform, in order to  allow users to find the conforming alternate version when they land on  a non-conforming page that they cannot use. </p>
				</item>
				<item>
					<p> Metadata can be used to locate and also to describe  alternate pages where there are multiple versions of a page which have  been developed, especially where the alternate pages are optimized for  individuals with different disabilities. The user can use the metadata  both to locate the alternate versions and to identify characteristics  of the versions, so that they can find the one that best meets their  needs. </p>
				</item>
				<item>
					<p>In addition to being used for whole pages (as in #1 and #2  above), metadata can be used to describe alternate versions of  subcomponents of a page. Again, the metadata can be used to find  alternate versions of a Web page component as well as to get  descriptions of the alternate versions ( if there are several) in order  to determine which one would best meet the user's needs. </p>
				</item>
			</olist>
			<div2 role="normal" id="understanding-metadata-resources">
				<head>Metadata Resources</head>
				<p>Metadata descriptions often provide values from defined, agreed  vocabularies such as the resource's subject matter or its date of  publication, and are machine readable - software that understands the  metadata scheme in use can do useful tasks not feasible otherwise.  Typically, an object having metadata may have one or more such metadata  descriptions. </p>
				<p>Well-known specifications (schemas) for metadata include: </p>

				</ulist>
				<p>There are some tools available to provide resource descriptions, or  they can be provided manually. The more easily the metadata can be  created and collected at point of creation of a resource or at point of  publication, the more efficient the process and the more likely it is  to take place. </p>
