			<p>This early draft document explores situations for which the WCAG 2.x conformance model is challenging to apply to large, complex, and/or dynamic websites, web applications, and mobile applications. These challenges broadly fall into four main areas: (1) numerous WCAG Guidelines and Success Criteria expect human involvement to verify conformance, which is challenging to scale to large sites and to dynamic sites; (2) large and dynamic sites have portions that are always under construction, which is challenging to address with the WCAG 2.x conformance model which makes no allowance for that; and (3) third parties frequently add and change content on large and dynamic sites, and related non-conformities in such content make WCAG 2.x conformance significantly challenging; and (4) applying the WCAG 2.x conformance model to non-web information and
				communications technologies (ICT).</p>
			<p>It is expected that a more thorough understanding of these challenges can lead to either a new conformance model, or an alternative model that is more appropriate for large, complex, and/or dynamic websites.  Ideally, such a model would also be able to distinguish between websites that are substantially accessible for most visitors with disabilities most of the time, and websites that are largely unusable by a significant portion of visitors with a disability.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Unchanged since WCAG 2.0 was published in December 2008, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines list a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance">set normative of requirements “in order for a web page to conform to” WCAG 2.x</a>, including setting forth that conformance “is for full Web page(s) only, and cannot be achieved if part of a Web page is excluded”, along with a Note that states “If a page cannot conform (for example, a conformance test page or an example page), it cannot be included in the scope of conformance or in a conformance claim.”  Also unchanged is text setting forth what is allowed in any optional “Conformance Claims”, starting with text that states: “Conformance is defined only for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#webpagedef">Web pages</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one page, a series of pages, or multiple related Web pages.”</p>
			<p>For the purposes of this document, we use the term “WCAG 2.x conformance model” to refer to the normative text in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance">Conformance section</a> of WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1.  We also note that this model was expressly defined for individual full web pages of a website, or for a series of web pages when they represent a process.  We further note that a conformance claim is specifically defined as something that covers “one page, a series of pages, or multiple related Web pages.” These terms, “a series of” and “multiple” are commonly understood in English to mean a fairly small number of items – more than one (e.g. “several”), but not many thousands or millions.</p>
			<p class="note">Language like “A Series of Unfortunate Events” “she published a series of books”, or “I subscribed to the concert series”; and language like “there were multiple births” or “there are multiple owners” all are broadly understood as not numbering in many thousands or millions.</p>
			<p>Large websites are often highly complex, with substantial dynamic content, including content updates, new content, and user interface changes that happen almost continuously, perhaps at the rate of hundreds or even thousands of page updates per second. This is especially the case where third parties are actively populating and changing site content. Fundamentally, these large sites are never finished. Some portion is always changing. In such situations, we should anticipate that portions of a web site will be incomplete or evolving for various reasons at any moment.  Thus, the likelihood that every last page (out of what might be millions or billions of pages) can satisfy each and every one of the WCAG success criteria 100% of the time is so low as to be impossible to expect. </p>
			<p>In this, these websites are not unlike the large urban environment of our cities. In any large and dynamic city, some number of buildings and/or parts of the urban infrastructure will be under construction or out of service at any given hour of any day – the city is never “finished being built”.  And during the construction, that building or infrastructure is likely not fully accessible. By the time construction ends, some other building will be going up, some other part of the urban infrastructure will be getting remodeled.</p>
			<p>While well managed urban infrastructure seeks to minimize the instances when this occurs and provide temporary workarounds for such circumstances, it may be impossible to do so in all cases (and we aren’t aware of any urban environment that has consistently and completely eliminated these issues). </p>
			<p>The goal of this work is not the avoidance of such situations, because they are as unavoidable on the web as in the physical world. The goal is the eventual establishment of reasonable consensus on expectations that maximize accessibility, and limit service downtime, in the on-line environment. We believe that a better understanding of the situations in which WCAG 2.x conformance applies poorly if at all, can lead to more effective models for large, complex, and dynamic websites. </p>

			<h2>Challenge #1: Specific WCAG Guidelines &amp; Success Criteria Expecting Human Involvement</h2>
			<p>A challenge common to many of the Guidelines and Success Criteria is the inability or cost for automatic testing to validate the quality of any alternative content or media.  The HTML markup designed for supporting accessibility can be automatically validated. What is challenging to be verified automatically is whether the criteria have been helpfully used, or whether the content they present to the user is appropriate. In other words, too many existing accessibility success criteria expect informed human evaluation.  For large and/or dynamic sites, perhaps numbering in the hundreds of thousands of pages or more, and for sites being updated hundreds or thousands of times per second or more, it is impossible for humans to validate every page and every update. </p>
			<p>We can think of this as the distinction between quantitative and qualitative analysis. We know how to automatically test for and count the occurrences of relevant markup. However, we do not yet know how to automatically verify the quality of what that markup conveys to the user. In the case of adjudging appropriate quality, informed human review is still required.</p>
			<p>This (growing) section describes challenges with applying the WCAG 2.x conformance model to specific Guidelines and Success Criteria, primarily based on required human involvement in evaluation of conformance to them.</p>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-alternatives">Text Alternatives to Non-Text Content (Guideline 1.1)</a></h3>
			<p>Text alternatives on images are an early, and still widely used, accessibility enhancement to HTML. Yet text alternatives remain one of the more intractable success criteria to assess with automated accessibility checking. While testing for the presence of alternative text is straight forward, and collection of specific errors (such as labeling a graphic "spacer.gif") can be identified by automated testing, human judgment remains necessary to evaluate whether or not any particular text alternative for a graphic is correct.  Image recognition techniques are not mature enough to fully discern the underlying meaning of an image and the intent of the author in its inclusion.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#time-based-media">Time-Based Media (Guideline 1.2)</a></h3>
			<p>Practices for creating alternatives to spoken dialog, and to describe visual content, were established in motion picture and TV content well before the world wide web came into existence. These practices formed the basis of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements (MAUR)</a> for time-based streaming media on the web in HTML5, which now supports both captioning and descriptions of video.</p>
			<p>Yet, just as with text alternatives, automated techniques and testing aren’t sufficient for creating and validating accessible alternatives to time-based media.  For example, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) often fails when the speech portion of the audio is low quality or isn’t clear. Work on automatically generated descriptions of video are in their infancy, and like image recognition techniques, don’t provide usable alternatives to video.</p>
			<p>Similarly, while there is well articulated guidance on how to create text transcripts or captions for audio-only media (such as radio programs and audio books), automated techniques and testing again aren’t sufficient for creating and validating these accessible alternatives.  Knowing what is important in an audio program to describe to someone who cannot hear is beyond the state of the art.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships">Info and Relationships (Success Criterion 1.3.1)</a></h3>
			<p>Whether in print or online, presentation of content is often structured in a manner intended to aid comprehension. Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues. Beyond simple sentences and paragraphs, the sighted user may see headings with nested subheadings. There may be sidebars and inset boxes of related content. Tables may be used to show data relationships. Comprehending how content is organized is a critical component of understanding the content.</p>
			<p>As with media above, automated testing can determine the presence of structural markup, and can flag certain visual presentations as likely needing that structural markup. But such automated techniques remain unable to decipher if that markup usefully organizes the page content in a way that the user relying on assistive technology can examine the page systematically and readily understand its content.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#meaningful-sequence">Meaningful Sequence (Success Criterion 1.3.2)</a></h3>
			<p>Often the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning. In some content there may be even more than one meaningful way of ordering that content. However, as with Info and Relationships above, automated techniques are unable to determine whether read aloud users will be able to read the content in a meaningful sequence ordering.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#sensory-characteristics">Sensory Characteristics (Success Criterion 1.3.3)</a></h3>
			<p>Ensuring that no instructions rely on references to sensory characteristics presents similar challenges to ensuring that color isn’t the sole indicator of meaning (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color">Success Criterion 1.4.1</a>) – it is testing for a negative, and requires a deep understanding of meaning conveyed by the text to discern a failure programmatically.  For example, while instructions such as “select the red button” reference a sensory characteristic, “select the red button which is also the first button on the screen” may provide sufficient non-sensory context to not cause a problem (and multi-modal, multi-sensory guidance is often better for users with cognitive impairments or non-typical learning styles).</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#orientation">Orientation (Success Criterion 1.3.4)</a></h3>
			<p>Evaluation of conformance to this criterion is tied to whether it is “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential">essential</a>” for the content to be locked to one specific orientation (e.g. portrait or landscape views of an interface rendered to a cell phone).  This requires human judgement, making this criterion not readily automatable.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color">Use of Color (Success Criterion 1.4.1)</a></h3>
			<p>This poses the same challenges as Sensory Characteristics (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#sensory-characteristics">Success Criterion 1.3.3</a>).  To discern whether a page fails this criterion programmatically requires understanding the full meaning of the rest of the content on the page and whether any meaning conveyed by color is somehow also conveyed in another fashion (e.g. whether the meaning of the colors in a bar chart is conveyed in the body of associated text or with a striping/stippling pattern as well on the bars, or perhaps in yet some other fashion).</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#images-of-text">Images of Text (Success Criterion 1.4.5)</a></h3>
			<p>This poses the same challenge as Orientation (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#orientation">Success Criterion 1.3.4</a>) - it is tied to whether it is “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential">essential</a>” for text to be part of an image.  This requires human judgement, making this criterion not readily automatable.</p>

				<h2>Challenge #2: Large, complex, and dynamic websites are always “under construction”</h2>
				<p>Large websites often have complex content publishing pipelines, which may render content dynamically depending upon a large number of variables (such as what is known about the logged in user and her content preferences, the geographical location that the user is visiting the site from, and the capabilities of the web rendering agent being used).  It may not be possible to validate every possible publishing permutation, each of which can have an impact on whether that particular rendering of the content at that particular moment conforms under the WCAG 2.x conformance model. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
				<h2>Challenge #3: 3rd party content</h2>
				<p>Very large, highly dynamic web sites generally aggregate content provided by multiple entities. Many of these are third parties with the ability to add content directly to the website – including potentially every website visitor. While the website can provide guidance on how to post content so that it meets WCAG Guidelines and Success Criteria, it is ultimately up to those third parties to understand and correctly implement that guidance.  And as noted above, even with automated checking prior to accepting the post, too many Guidelines and Success Criteria expect human validation involvement.</p>
				<p>Copyright and other things that restrict the ability to modify or impose requirements on third party data can also make full page conformance impossible to assure. For instance: articles that allow reposting
				   but without modification due to copyright restrictions.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
				<h2>Challenge #4: Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies </h2>
				<p>The core principles, and many of the guidelines, contained in WCAG 2.x, are broadly applicable outside of the web context.  For example, no matter the technology, information presented to humans needs to be perceivable by them in order for them to access and use it.  At the same time, some of the specific guidelines and especially some of the individual success criteria of WCAG 2.x are written specifically for web content and web technologies, and may be difficult to apply to non-web information and communications technologies (as set forth in the Working Group Note “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/">Applying WCAG to Non-Web Information and Communication Technologies</a>” or “WCAG2ICT”).  A number of entities looking to apply WCAG 2.x to non-web ICT have made use of the guidance in WCAG2ICT when drafting regulations and requirements in their
					contexts and countries.</p>
				<p>Where non-web ICT share similar characteristics of size, complexity, and dynamism as large, complex, and dynamic websites, &lt;&lt;FINISH ME>></p>
				<p>Some of the specific Success Criteria pose specific challenges in the WCAG2ICT context.</p>
				<section>
					<h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#identify-input-purpose">Identify Input Purpose (Success Criterion 1.3.5)</a></h3>
					<p>This Success Criterion specifies that an input field’s purpose must be “identified in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes">Input Purposes for User Interface Components section</a>” of WCAG 2.x.  Unfortunately, few if any operating systems or platforms have the same or an equivalent definition of input components that can be conveyed to assistive technologies [add reference to Yet Another Accessibility API Mapping project here].</p>
