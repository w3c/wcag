         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#focus-appearance-enhanced" style="font-weight: bold;">2.4.12 Focus Appearance (Enhanced)</a> (Level AAA): When <a href="#dfn-user-interface-component">user interface components</a> have keyboard focus, all of the following are true:
         </p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a href="#">focus indicator area</a> is double the area of a 1 <a href="#dfn-css-pixel">CSS pixel</a> perimeter of the unfocused component;
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Change of contrast:</strong> The pixels making up the minimum focus indicator area achieve at least a 4.5:1 contrast
               ratio between their colors in the focused and unfocused states.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Not obscured:</strong> No part of the focus indicator is hidden by author-created content.

         <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do
            not meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal
            to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is highly
               visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="./focus-appearance-minimum.html">Success Criterion 2.4.11 Focus Appearance (Minimum)</a> and defines a higher level of visibility for the focus indicator.
            </p>
            <p>In relation to Focus Visible (enhanced) this criterion:</p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Expands the minimum area to 2 CSS pixels around the perimeter.</li>
               
               <li>Increases the change of contrast to 4.5:1.</li>
               
               <li>Does not allow for any part of the element to be obscured by other content.</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>The other aspects of the success criterion are the same as Focus Visible (Minimum).</p>

               <li>Sighted keyboard users can visually determine which component will be interacted with
                  using keyboard operations.

               <li>People with low vision are better able to follow a highly visible focus indicator.</li>
               
               <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in
                  executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.
