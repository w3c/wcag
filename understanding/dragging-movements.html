            <h2>Status</h2>
            
            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure functionality that uses a dragging
               movement (e.g. sliders, drag-and-drop interfaces) has another <a href="#dfn-single-pointer">single pointer</a> mode of operation without the need for the dexterity required to drag elements.
            </p>
            <p>Some people cannot perform dragging motions in a precise manner. Others use a specialized
               or adapted input device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled
               mouse emulator, which makes dragging cumbersome, error-prone, or outright impossible.
            </p>
            <p>When an interface implements functionality that uses dragging motions, some users
               can tap or click, but not accurately maintain contact whilst performing a dragging
               motion. An alternative method must be provided so that users with mobility impairments
               that use a pointer (mouse, pen, or touch contact) can use the functionality.
            </p>
            <p>There is already a requirement for dragging features to be keyboard accessible, however,
               it is possible to create an interface that works with dragging and keyboard controls
               that does not work using only clicks or taps.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion applies to dragging motions as opposed to pointer gestures
               which are covered in Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures. Pointer gestures include
               directional path-based as well as multi-point gestures. In contrast, for dragging
               motions, only the start and end point of the motion matters, not the actual path.
            </p>
            <p>2.1.1 Keyboard and 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) require dragging features to be keyboard
               accessible, however, it is possible to create an interface that works with dragging
               and keyboard controls that does not work using only clicks or taps.
            </p>
            <p>There may be cases where a dragging movement is essential, for example, drawing a
               freeform figure, or playing a game where the aim is to follow a particular path as
               accurately as possible. The criterion has an exception for these cases where the task
               requires dragging.
            </p>
            <p>Some tasks may typically involve dragging, such as sorting items in a list, but as
               there are other ways to achieve that task they are not considered essential.
            </p>
            <p>A dragging movement is a pointer interaction where only the endpoints matter. Once
               the pointer engages with a target, the target (or a position mark related to the target)
               will follow the pointer regardless of the direction of the pointer movement. The target's
               movement may be constrained to one axis and often, to a particular range on that axis,
               but within those constraints, the x or y position of the target will mirror the corresponding
               x or y position of the pointer until the pointer disengages the target.
            </p>
            <p>In contrast to dragging movements, path-based gestures involve at least an initial
               directionality of the pointer movement. This is defined by stating that the path has
               to go through at least one intermediate point to qualify as pointer gesture. The intermediate
               point defines the gesture as requiring a specific path, even if the complete path
               is not defined. For more details, refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html">Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures</a>.

               <li>A sortable list of elements may, after focussing a list element, provide adjacent
                  controls for moving the element up or down in the list by simply tapping/clicking
                  on those controls.
               </li>
               
               <li>A kanban implementation may provide an additional pop-up menu for focused elements
                  that can be activated by simple clicks/taps providing an option for moving the selected
                  element to another kanban silo.
               </li>
               
               <li>A radial control widget where the value can be set by dragging includes a text field
                  that presents the current value and offers the input of the desired value via a keyboard
                  (including on-screen virtual keyboards).
