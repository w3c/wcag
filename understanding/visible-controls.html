            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user interface components (controls)
               can be found easily by people with cognitive disabilities, vision loss, and mobility
               and motor impairments.
            </p>
            <p>Some design approaches hide controls and require certain user interactions, such as
               mouseover, to reveal them (both visually and programmatically). Where the hidden controls
               are needed to complete tasks, the difficulty in discovering the controls can leave
               some users with disabilities without a way to progress.

               <h3>Cognitive disabilities</h3>
               
               
               <p>People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning
                  disabilities may not be able to find hidden controls. If a hidden control is needed
                  in order to progress, this can prevent some users from completing a task. Users who
                  discover controls that display on hover may not remember how to show and operate the
                  controls the next time they interact with the site. So even when a user is able to
                  proceed, time on task can be affected for both one-time and repeated uses.

               <h3>Vision loss</h3>
               
               
               <p>One of the main challenges for people with vision loss is simply locating related
                  controls on the screen, moving the mouse from control to control, and getting the
                  keyboard focus to coincide with where they are looking. This Success Criterion can
                  help reduce that cumulative load.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>People with vision loss may not see controls that display only on hover or focus,
                  particularly if they display outside of the viewport. For users who require enlarged
                  or magnified content, the portion of the content in the viewport may be significantly
                  reduced. Low vision users may have 800 x 600 resolution as the default. They may look
                  closely at the monitor from a few inches away due to limited acuity (inability to
                  see detail) or Scotomas (blind spots).  They may have a significant amount of head
                  and neck movement while using content. When users don't see something on the screen,
                  they may assume they are missing it — for example, that it’s in their blind spot or
                  hidden in a menu — and go searching until they either find it or give up searching.

               <p>People who use alternative input methods may have difficulty locating and operating
                  controls that display only on hover or focus. For example, speech recognition users
                  activate controls by speaking the name of the control. Functions that are only exposed
                  through hover interaction or keyboard focus can pose significant barriers to alternative
                  input methods.

               <h3>When Needed</h3>
               
               
               <p>Information needed to identify controls does not need to be visible all the time.
                  But information needed to identify controls must be visible without hover interaction
                  or keyboard focus  <i>when the controls are needed</i>. For example, if the control is required to carry out a task or progress through
                  a user process. Controls can be available through a persistent <b><i>visible entry point</i></b>, such as a menu button that opens subitems. In a multi-step process or multi-part
                  form, controls may be hidden in an earlier step or part; however, at the time the
                  user can move the process forward, the information needed to identify the control,
                  which is usually the control itself, must be visible without hover interaction or
                  keyboard focus.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Ideally the information needed to identify controls exist would be visible all the
                  time. Controls can be available through a persistent visible entry point, such as
                  a menu button that opens subitems. There are also several exceptions outlined in the
                  criterion text:
               </p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>If controls are provided in multiple locations on a page or at multiple points within
                     a process, at least one of the instances of the control must be visible without hover
                     interaction or keyboard focus. For example, with an email reader some controls such
                     as Trash may be visible when hovering over individual messages in the inbox list view.
                     Those controls will always be visible on the email view so they do not need to be
                     persistently visible on the inbox view.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>If the control is to enhance keyboard navigation. For example, a link that skips from
                     the top of the page to the navigation could become visible only on focus.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>If there is a mechanism to make the indicators persistently visible. For example,
                     a button at the top of the page could make all the hidden controls visible without
                     needing to hover over them.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>If hiding the information needed to identify the component is essential. For example,
                     a memory game hides the controls for selecting a card to flip over.
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               
               <p>The exception for components that provide "keyboard-only functionality" is to allow
                  for features such as skip links, which are not visible by default. As they appear
                  on focus, and are aimed at keyboard-only users, they are not intended to be covered
                  by this criterion.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The following images highlight when a hidden hover feature is used, and there should
                  be an indicator of those controls
               </p>

               <h3>Embedded Controls</h3>
               		
               
               <p>Information needed to identify user interface components is usually the component
                  itself; however, there are situations where controls are not visible. Complex components
                  such as video players and carousels often include controls that are visible on hover.
                  The presence of the complex component — for example, the carousel component or the
                  video image — provides the “Information needed to identify the user interface components.”
                  For a carousel, controls displayed on hover should also be displayed when the carousel
                  is activated. For a video player, activating the video image should launch the video
                  (sometimes in a new window), at which point more video player controls, including
                  controls displayed previously on hover, should be visible. Some users may still struggle
                  if video controls are not persistently visible, so there is benefit to providing a
                  mechanism that allows users to have the controls persistently visible.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Many scenarios are out of scope because they do not rely on hover or focus, for example:</p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>Options/fields become visible because of a <b>selection</b> elsewhere on the form. For example, address and City fields only appearing once the
                     user has selected a State.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>An e-reader that allows the user to <b>select</b> a text passage and then pops-up a contextual toolbar with buttons that allows the
                     user to interact with that text.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>Controls that become visible upon scrolling, such as a confirmation button that only
                     appears when the user has scrolled through all the content in a Terms and Conditions
                     dialog.
