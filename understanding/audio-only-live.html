            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by live audio,
               such as video conferencing, live speeches and radio Webcasts, accessible through the
               use of a text alternative. A live text caption service will enable live audio to be
               accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who cannot otherwise hear
               the audio. Such services use a trained human operator who listens in to what is being
               said and uses a special keyboard to enter the text with only a small delay. They are
               able to capture a live event with a high degree of fidelity, and also to insert notes
               on any non spoken audio which is essential to understanding the event. A transcript
               is sometimes a possibility if the live audio is following a set script; but a live
               caption service is preferred because it plays out at the same pace as the audio itself,
               and can adapt to any deviations from the script that might occur.
               
            </p>
            <p>Using untrained operators, or providing a transcript which differs markedly from what
               actually happens would not be considered meeting this Success Criterion. 
               
            </p>
            <p>This success criterion was intended to apply to broadcast of audio and is not intended
               to require that two-way audio calls between two or more individuals through web apps
               must be captioned regardless of the needs of users. Responsibility for providing captions
               would fall to the content providers (the callers) or the “host” caller, and not the
               application.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>A public relations firm uses Web based caption services to cover live events; the
                  output from the service is incorporated in a sub frame of the Web page which includes
                  the streaming audio control.
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>A live radio play of a fringe theatre group is being broadcast to the Web. As the
                  actors stick largely to a set script, and the budget for the program is small, the
                  producers provide a link (with the playwright's permission) to the script of the play.
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>A streaming audio server uses a technology which can also accommodate text and graphics,
                  such as HTML5 or Silverlight. A stenographer is used to create live captions at an
                  event, and these are mixed on the fly to produce live captions in the media stream
                  which can be viewed by the media player. 
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>A CEO is to give a press release by telephone to the media in response to a breaking
                  news story, the audio is being recorded and streamed over the internet, but due to
                  time constraints a Web captioning service cannot be set up in time. As the press release
                  is a set statement which the CEO will be reading out, the company simultaneously provides
                  the transcript of the release.
