         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#label-in-name" style="font-weight: bold;">2.5.3 Label in Name</a> (Level A): For <a href="#dfn-user-interface-component">user interface components</a> with <a href="#dfn-label">labels</a> that include <a href="#dfn-text">text</a> or <a href="#dfn-image-of-text">images of text</a>, the <a href="#dfn-name">name</a> contains the text that is presented visually.

      <main>
         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the words which visually label
               a component are also the words associated with the component programmatically. This
               helps ensure that people with disabilities can rely on visible labels as a means to
               interact with the components.
            </p>
            <p>Most controls are accompanied by a visible text <strong>label</strong>. Those same controls have a programmatic <strong>name</strong>, also known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/">Accessible Name</a>. Users typically have a much better experience if the words and characters in the
               visible label of a control match or are contained within the accessible name. When
               these match, speech-input users (i.e., users of speech recognition applications) can
               navigate by speaking the visible text labels of components, such as menus, links,
               and buttons, that appear on the screen. Sighted users who use text-to-speech (e.g.,
               screen readers) will also have a better experience if the text they hear matches the
               text they see on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>Note that where a visible text label does not exist for a component, this Success
               Criterion does not apply to that component.
            </p>
            <p>Where text labels exist and are properly linked to the user interface components through
               established authoring practices, the label and name will normally match. When they
               don't match, speech-input users who attempt to use the visible text label as a means
               of navigation or selection (e.g., "move to Password") will be unsuccessful.  The speech-based
               navigation fails because the visible label spoken by the users does not match (or
               is not part of) the accessible name that is enabled as a speech-input command. In
               addition, when the accessible name is different from the visible label, it may function
               as a hidden command that can be accidentally activated by speech-input users.
            </p>
            <p>Mismatches between visible labels and programmatic names for controls are even more
               of an issue for speech-input and text-to-speech users who also have cognitive challenges.
               Mismatches create an extra cognitive load for speech-input users, who must remember
               to say a speech command that is different from the visible label they see on a control.
               It also creates extra cognitive load for a text-to-speech user to absorb and understand
               speech output that does not match the visible label.
            </p>
            <p>In order for the label text and accessible name to be matched, it is first necessary
               to determine which text on the screen should be considered a label for any given control.
               There are often multiple text strings in a user interface that may be relevant to
               a control. However, there are reasons why it is best to conservatively interpret the
               label as being only the text in close proximity.
            </p>
            <p>Conventionally the label for user interface components is the adjacent text string.
               The typical positioning for left to right languages is:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>immediately to the left of comboboxes, dropdown lists, text inputs, and other widgets
                  (or in the absence of left-side labels, immediately above and aligned with the left
                  edge of each input)
               </li>
               
               <li>immediately to the right of checkboxes and radio buttons</li>
               
               <li>inside buttons and tabs or immediately below icons serving as buttons</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>The rationale for some of these conventions is explained in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2016/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20160105/G162">G162: Positioning labels to maximize predictability of relationships</a>.
               
            </p>
            <p>It is important to bias towards treating only the adjacent text as a label because
               liberal interpretations of what constitutes a text label can jeopardize the value
               of this Success Criterion (SC) by lessening predictability. Isolating the label to
               the single string in close proximity to the component makes it easier for developers,
               testers, and end users to identify the label targeted for evaluation in this SC. Predictable
               interpretation of labeling allows users of speech recognition technologies to interact
               with the element via its conventionally positioned label, and allows users of screen
               reading technologies to enjoy consistency between the nearby visible label and the
               announced name of the component.
            </p>
            <p>Note that placeholder text within an input field is not considered an appropriate
               means of providing a label. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#the-placeholder-attribute">HTML5 specification</a> states <q>The placeholder attribute should not be used as an alternative to a &lt;label&gt;.</q> However, it is worth noting that "label" in that HTML5 statement is in code brackets
               and links to the <code>label</code> element. For the purposes of this Label in Name Success Criterion, "label" is not
               used in such a programmatic sense but is simply referring to a text string in close
               visual proximity to a component. As such, in the absence of any other nearby text
               string (as described in the preceding list), if an input contains placeholder text,
               such text may be a candidate for Label in Name. This is supported both through the
               accessible name calculation (discussed later) and from the practical sense that where
               a visible label is not otherwise provided, it is likely that a speech-input user may
               attempt to use the placeholder text value as a means of interacting with the input.

                  <h4>Symbolic text characters</h4>
                  
                  <p>For the purposes of this SC, text should not be considered a visible label if it is
                     used in a symbolic manner, rather than directly <q>expressing something in human language</q> as per the definition of <a href="#dfn-text">text</a> in WCAG. For example, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#images-of-text">1.4.5 Images of Text</a> describes considerations for "symbolic text characters." In the images of text example
                     "B", "I", and "ABC" appear on icons in a text editor, where they are meant to symbolize
                     the functions for Bold, Italics, and Spelling, respectively. In such a case, the accessible
                     name should be the function the button serves (e.g., "Spell check" or "Check spelling"),
                     not the visible symbolic characters. A similar text editor is shown in the figure
                     below.
                  </p>
                  
                  <figure id="figure-RTE-github">

                  <p>Likewise, where an author has used a greater-than symbol ("&gt;") to mimic the appearance
                     of the right-facing arrow, the text does not convey something in human language. It
                     is a symbol, in this scenario likely meant to mimic the icons used for a "Play" button
                     or a "Next" arrow.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>Punctuation and capitalization</h4>
                  				
               </section>
               				
               <section id="">
                  
                  <p>The use of punctuation and capitalization in labels <em>may</em> also be considered optional for the same reason. For example, the colon conventionally
                     added at the end of input labels does not express something in human language, and
                     capitals on the first letter of each word in a label do not normally alter the words'
                     meaning. This is particularly relevant in the context of this SC, since it is primarily
                     aimed at users of speech recognition; capitals and most punctuation are frequently
                     ignored when a user speaks a label as a means of interacting with a control.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>While it is certainly not an error to include the colon and capitalization in the
                     accessible name, a computed name of "First name" should not be considered a failure
                     of "First Name:".<br />
                     <label for="firstname">First Name: </label><input id="firstname" type="text" name="firstname" /><br />
                     Likewise, "Next…" visibly shown on a button could have "Next" as the accessible name.
                     When in doubt, where a meaningful visible label exists, match the string exactly for
                     the accessible name.<br />
                     <input type="submit" value="Next..." /></p>
                  				
               </section>
               				
               <section id="mathematical-expressions-and-formulae">
                  
                  
                  <h4>Mathematical expressions and formulae</h4>
                  
                  <p>Mathematical expressions are an exception to the previous subsection about symbolic
                     characters. Math symbols can be used as labels; for example "11×3=33" and "A&gt;B" convey
                     meaning. The label should not be overwritten in the accessible name, and substitutions
                     of words where a formula is used should be avoided since there are multiple ways to
                     express the same equation. For example, making the name "eleven multiplied by three
                     is equivalent to thirty-three" might mean a user who said "eleven times three equals
                     thirty-three" may not match. It is best to leave the formulas as used in the label
                     and count on the user's familiarity with their speech software to achieve a match.
                     Further, converting a mathematical formula label into an accessible name that is a
                     spelled-out equivalent may create issues for translation. The name should match the
                     label's formula text. Note that a consideration for authors is to use the proper symbol
                     in the formula. For instance 11x3 (with a lower or upper case letter X), 11*3 (with
                     the asterisk symbol), and 11×3 (with the <code>&amp;</code>times<code>;</code> symbol) are all easy for sighted users to interpret as meaning the same formula,
                     but may not all be matched to "11 times 3" by the speech recognition software. The
                     proper operator symbol (in this case the times symbol) should be used.<br />
                     
                     <input type="radio" name="equation" id="answer1" value="A&gt;B" /><label for="answer1">A&gt;B</label>

               <h3>Accessible Name and Description Computation specification</h3>
               
               <p>It is important to understand how the accessible name is derived. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/">Accessible Name and Description Computation 1.1</a> and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation">HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0</a> describe how the accessible name is computed, including which attributes are considered
                  in its calculation, and in what order of preference. If a component has multiple possible
                  attribute values that could be used for its accessible name, only the most preferred
                  of those values will be computed. None of the other, less preferred values will be
                  part of the name. For the most part, existing established programmatic relationships
                  between labels and controls are reinforced by the specification.
               </p>
               
               <p>Other text displayed on the screen that is correctly coded to meet 1.3.1: Info and
                  Relationships is <strong>not</strong> normally factored into the calculation for the accessible name of a UI component
                  without author intervention (via ARIA labeling techniques). The most common of these
                  are:
               </p>
               	
               <ul>
                  		
                  <li>headings and instructions</li>
                  
                  <li>group labels for sets of components (i.e., used with <code>legend</code>/<code>fieldset</code> or with role of <code>group</code> or <code>radiogroup</code>)
                  </li> 
                  
               </ul>
               
               <p>Such textual information may constitute part of the component's <em>description</em>. So from both a programmatic viewpoint, and from the conservative tactic of only
                  considering a label to be "adjacent text," neither headings, instructions, nor group
                  'labels' should normally be considered <strong>labels</strong> for the purpose of this Success Criterion.
               </p>
               
               <p>It is important to note that the specification allows authors to override the name
                  calculated through native semantics. Both <code>aria-label</code> and <code>aria-labelledby</code> take precedence in the name calculation, overriding the visible text as the accessible
                  name even when the visible text label is programmatically associated with the control.
                  For this reason, when a visible label already exists, <code>aria-label</code> should be avoided or used carefully, and <code>aria-labelledby</code> should be used as a supplement with care.
               </p>
               
               <p>Finally, <code>aria-describedby</code> is not included in the Accessible Name computation (instead it is part of the Accessible
                  Description computation). By convention, text associated with a control through <code>aria-describedby</code> is announced immediately after the accessible name by screen readers. Therefore,
                  the context of headings, instructions, and group labels can be provided through the
                  accessible description to assist users of screen readers without affecting the experience
                  of those who navigate using speech recognition software.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
