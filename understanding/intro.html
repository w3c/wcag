         <p>Understanding WCAG 2.1 is an essential guide to understanding and using "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1</a>". Although the normative definition and requirements for WCAG 2.1 can all be found
            in the WCAG 2.1 document itself, the concepts and provisions may be new to some people.
            Understanding WCAG 2.1 provides a non-normative extended commentary on each guideline
            and each Success Criterion to help readers better understand the intent and how the
            guidelines and Success Criteria work together. It also provides examples of techniques
            or combinations of techniques that the Working Group has identified as being sufficient
            to meet each Success Criterion. Links are then provided to write-ups for each of the
            techniques.
         </p>
         		
         <p>This is not an introductory document. It is a detailed technical description of the
            guidelines and their Success Criteria. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a> for an introduction to WCAG, supporting technical documents, and educational material.
            
         </p>
         		
         <p>Understanding WCAG 2.1 is organized by guideline. There is an <em>Understanding Guideline X.X</em> section for each guideline. The intent and any advisory techniques that are related
            to the guideline but not specifically related to any of its Success Criteria are listed
            there as well.
         </p>
         		
         <p>The <em>Understanding Guidelines X.X</em> section is then followed by a <em>Understanding Success Criterion X.X.X</em> section for each Success Criterion of that guideline. These sections each contain:

            <h2>Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility</h2>
            			
            <p>The guidelines and Success Criteria are organized around the following four principles,
               which lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use Web content. Anyone
               who wants to use the Web must have content that is:
            </p>
            			
            <ol>
               				
               <li>
                  					
                  <p> Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users
                     in ways they can perceive.
                  </p>
                  					
                  <ul>
                     						
                     <li>
                        							
                        <p>This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it
                           can't be invisible to all of their senses)
                        </p>
                        						
                     </li>
                     					
                  </ul>
                  				
               </li>
               				
               <li>
                  					
                  <p>Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>
                  					
                  <ul>
                     						
                     <li>
                        							
                        <p>This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot
                           require interaction that a user cannot perform) 
                        </p>
                        						
                     </li>
                     					
                  </ul>
                  				
               </li>
               				
               <li>
                  					
                  <p>Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>
                  					
                  <ul>
                     						
                     <li>
                        							
                        <p>This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation
                           of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)
                        </p>
                        						
                     </li>
                     					
                  </ul>
                  				
               </li>
               				
               <li>
                  					
                  <p>Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide
                     variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
                  </p>
                  					
                  <ul>
                     						
                     <li>
                        							
                        <p>This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as
                           technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)
                        </p>
                        						
                     </li>
                     					
                  </ul>
                  				
               </li>
               			
            </ol>
            			
            <p>If any of these are not true, users with disabilities will not be able to use the
               Web. 
            </p>
            			
            <p>Under each of the principles are guidelines and Success Criteria that help to address
               these principles for people with disabilities. There are many general usability guidelines
               that make content more usable by all people, including those with disabilities. However,
               in WCAG 2.1, we only include those guidelines that address problems particular to
               people with disabilities. This includes issues that block access or interfere with
               access to the Web more severely for people with disabilities.

               <h3>The Guidelines</h3>
               				
               <p>Under each principle there is a list of guidelines that address the principle. There
                  are a total of 12 guidelines. A convenient list of just the guidelines can be found
                  in the <a class="gl-ref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#toc">WCAG 2.1 table of contents</a>. One of the key objectives of the guidelines is to ensure that content is directly
                  accessible to as many people as possible, and capable of being re-presented in different
                  forms to match different peoples' sensory, physical and cognitive abilities.

            <section id="success-criteria">
               				
               <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
               				
               <p>Under each guideline, there are Success Criteria that describe specifically what must
                  be achieved in order to <a class="gl-ref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conform">conform</a> to this standard. They are similar to the "checkpoints" in WCAG 1.0. Each Success
                  Criterion is written as a statement that will be either true or false when specific
                  Web content is tested against it. The Success Criteria are written to be technology
                  neutral.
               </p>
               				
               <p>All WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria are written as testable criteria for objectively determining
                  if content satisfies the Success Criteria. While some of the testing can be automated
                  using software evaluation programs, others require human testers for part or all of
                  the test.
               </p>
               				
               <p>Although content may satisfy the Success Criteria, the content may not always be usable
                  by people with a wide variety of disabilities. Professional reviews utilizing recognized
                  qualitative heuristics are important in achieving accessibility for some audiences.
                  In addition, usability testing is recommended. Usability testing aims to determine
                  how well people can use the content for its intended purpose.
               </p>
               				
               <p>The content should be tested by those who understand how people with different types
                  of disabilities use the Web. It is recommended that users with disabilities be included
                  in test groups when performing human testing. 
               </p>
