            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to prevent animation from being
               displayed on Web pages. Some users experience distraction or nausea from animated
               content. For example, if scrolling a page causes elements to move (other than the
               essential movement associated with scrolling) it can trigger vestibular disorders.
               Vestibular (inner ear) disorder reactions include dizziness, nausea and headaches.
               Another animation that is often non-essential is parallax scrolling. Parallax scrolling
               occurs when backgrounds move at a different rate to foregrounds. Animation that is
               essential to the functionality or information of a web page is allowed by this Success
               Criterion.
            </p>
            <p>"Animation from interactions" applies when a user’s interaction initiates non-essential
               animation. In contrast, <a href="pause-stop-hide.html">2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</a> applies when the web page initiates animation.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>The impact of animation on people with vestibular disorders can be quite severe. Triggered
                  reactions include nausea, migraine headaches, and potentially needing bed rest to
                  recover.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>How can a website reduce the chances of triggering a vestibular disorder?</strong> Choose any one of the following solutions. Avoid using unnecessary animation. Provide
               a control for users to turn off non-essential animations from user interaction. Take
               advantage of the reduce motion feature in the user agent or operating system.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What about movement caused by a user scrolling a page?</strong> Moving new content into the viewport is essential for scrolling. The user controls
               the essential scrolling movement so it is allowed. Only add non-essential animation
               to the scrolling interaction in a responsible way. Always give users the ability to
               turn off unnecessary movement.

                     <li>A site includes extra animations when the user scrolls. Decorative elements move in
                        and out of view horizontally when the essential page content is scrolled vertically.
                        A control at the top of each page allows the user to turn off unnecessary animations.
                        The ability to turn off non-essential animations is a site-wide setting.

                     <li>A site includes a non-essential transition when loading new content. The transition
                        is a page-flipping animation that respects the reduce-motion CSS media query. When
                        the user enables the reduce motion preference, the page-flipping animation is turned
                        off.
