            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users find content and orient themselves
               within it by ensuring that each Web page has a descriptive title. Titles identify
               the current location without requiring users to read or interpret page content. When
               titles appear in site maps or lists of search results, users can more quickly identify
               the content they need. User agents make the title of the page easily available to
               the user for identifying the page. For instance, a user agent may display the page
               title in the  window title bar or as the name of the tab containing the page.
               
            </p>
            <p>In cases where the page is a document or a web application, the name of the document
               or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page. Note that
               it is not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things
               may also describe the purpose or the topic of the page. 
               
            </p>

               <a href="link-purpose-in-context" class="understanding">Success Criteria 2.4.4</a> and 
               <a href="link-purpose-link-only" class="understanding">2.4.9</a> deal with the purpose of links, many of which are links to web pages. Here also,
               the name of a document or web application being linked to would be sufficient to describe
               the purpose of the link. Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar,
               is good practice and provides continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web
               page that the user lands on.

                        (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g.,

                        (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

                     <p>Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents
                        by using and monitoring APIs.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.

                        visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing,
                        color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability
