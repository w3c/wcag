            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content can be controlled with
               a range of pointing devices, abilities, and assistive technologies. Some people  cannot
               perform gestures in a precise manner, or they may use a specialized or adapted input
               device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled mouse emulator.
               Some pointing methods lack the capability or accuracy to perform multipoint or path-based
               gestures.
               
            </p>
            <p>A <strong>path-based gesture</strong> involves an interaction where not just the endpoints matter. If going  through an
               intermediate point (usually near the start of the gesture) also affects its meaning
               then it is a path-based gesture. The user engages a pointer (starting point), carries
               out a movement that goes through at least one intermediate-point before disengaging
               the pointer (end point). The intermediate point defines the gesture as requiring a
               specific path, even if the complete path is not defined.
               
            </p>

               <figcaption>Figure 1A path-based gesture involves starting a pointer movement that goes through at least
                  one intermediate point before the end-point. The end-point may be a continuation,
                  or allow for various movements.

            </figure>
            <p>Examples of path-based gestures include swiping, sliders and carousels dependent on
               the direction of interaction, and other gestures which trace a prescribed path such
               as the drawing a specific shape. Such paths may be drawn with a finger or stylus on
               a touchscreen, graphics tablet, or trackpad, or with a mouse, joystick, or similar
               pointer device.
               
            </p>
            <p>Pointer interactions where the movement between the start and end points can go in
               any direction and are entirely non-prescriptive are not path-based.

               <figcaption>Figure 2A free-form gesture does not require any particular path before the end-point, only
                  the start and (optionally) the end point matter.

               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>Any movement of a pointer could be difficult or impossible to use for someone who
                  cannot perform precise movements, therefore alternative forms of interaction are always
                  recommended. This success criterion is scoped to <em>path-based gestures</em> as it may be difficult or impossible to provide an alternative for free-form paths.
                  
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Examples of <strong>multipoint</strong> gestures include a two-finger pinch zoom, a split tap where one finger rests on the
               screen and a second finger taps, or a two- or three-finger tap or swipe. Users may
               find it difficult or impossible to accomplish these if they type and point with a
               single finger or stick.
               
            </p>
            <p>Authors must ensure that their content can be operated without multipoint or path-based
               gestures. Multipoint or path-based gestures can be used so long as the functionality
               can also be operated by another method, such as a tap, click, double tap, double click,
               long press, or click &amp; hold. 
               
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion applies to gestures in the author-provided content, not gestures
               defined by the operating system, user agent, or assistive technology. Examples of
               operating system gestures would be swiping down to see system notifications and gestures
               for built-in assistive technologies (AT). Examples of user-agent-implemented gestures
               would be horizontal swiping implemented by browsers for navigating within the page
               history, or vertical swiping to scroll page content.
               
            </p>
            <p>There are times when a component requires a path-based gesture for touch screen devices
               but not with a mouse. Taking an example of a generic slider:
               
            </p>
            <ul>
               				
               
               <li><strong>Using a mouse:</strong> If the user clicks on the thumb control of the slider and moves vertically, the slider
                  will respond by moving to the right or left, even if the movement is mostly upwards.
                  There will be no page scrolling as a result of the vertical movement as long as they
                  drag with focus on the slider. Therefore, the slider does not require a path-based
                  gesture with mouse pointer.
                  
               </li>
               				
               
               <li><strong>Using a touch-screen:</strong> If the user puts their finger on the thumb control of the slider and moves upwards
                  more than sideways, the slider may not respond because the browser takes control of
                  the swipe and interprets it as a scroll, and will move the page up and down. Moving
                  left or right on the slider thumb engages the slider and then the user can vary their
                  vertical movement. This implementation has the 3-point requirement to work with a
                  finger on a touch screen device so is a path-based gesture.
                  
               </li>
               			
               
            </ul>
            <p>As touch screen devices can apply default gestures it is important to test with them
               if you are unsure whether a particular component does require a path-based gesture.
               
            </p>
            <p>Browsers on a touch screen device generally provide some default gestures that impact
               whether a path-based gesture is needed. For example, a web browser on a touch-screen
               devices might detect a vertical gesture and scroll the page. If a user places their
               finger on a slider thumb and moves up (to scroll down) that might not activate the
               slider (depending on implementation). If the user moves horizontally first then the
               slider could capture that gesture and ignore vertical movement, resulting in a path-based
               gesture. If you include touch-screen devices as accessibility supported then these
               types of interaction need testing with a touch screen as using a mouse in a similar
               way would not trigger the same browser behavior.
               
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion does not require all functionality to be available through
               pointing devices, but if it is available to pointer devices then it should not require
               path-based gestures. While content authors generally need to provide keyboard commands
               or other non-pointer mechanisms that perform actions equivalent to complex gestures
               (see Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard), this is not sufficient to conform to this
               Success Criterion. That is because some users rely entirely on pointing devices, or
               find simple pointer inputs much easier than alternatives. For example, a user relying
               on a head-pointer would find clicking a control to be much more convenient than activating
               an on-screen keyboard to emulate a keyboard shortcut, and a person who has difficulty
               memorizing a series of keys (or gestures) may find it much easier to simply click
               on a labeled control. Therefore, if one or more pointer-based mechanisms are supported,
               then their benefits should be afforded to users through simple, single-point actions
               alone.
               
            </p>
            <p>An exception is made for functionality that is inherently and necessarily based on
               complex paths or multipoint gestures. For example, entering your signature may be
               inherently path-based (although acknowledging something or confirming your identity
               need not be).
               
            </p>
            <p>Gestures that involve dragging in any direction are not in scope for this SC because
               only the start and end points matter in a dragging operation. However, such gestures
               do require fine motor control. Authors are encouraged to provide non-dragging methods,
               for instance, a drag and drop operation could also be achieved by selecting an item
               (with a tap or keyboard interaction) and then selecting its destination as a second
               step.
