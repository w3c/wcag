            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Crition is to reduce accidental activation of keyboard
               shortcuts. Character key shortcuts work well for many keyboard users, but are inappropriate
               and frustrating for speech input users — whose means of input is strings of letters
               — and for keyboard users who are prone to accidentally hit keys.
               To rectify this issue, authors need to allow users to turn off or reconfigure shortcuts
               that are made up of only character keys.
               
            </p>
            <p>Note that this success criterion doesn't affect components such as listboxes and drop-down
               menus. Although these components contain values (words) that may be selected by one
               or more character keys, the shortcuts are only active when the components have focus.
               Other components such as menus may be accessed or opened with a single non-character
               shortcut (e.g., Alt or Alt+F) before pressing a single character key to select an
               item. This makes the full path to invoking a menu a two-step shortcut that includes
               a non-printable key. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/single-page.html#the-accesskey-attribute">Accesskeys</a> are also not affected because they include modifier keys.
            </p>
            <p>Speech Input users generally work in a single mode where they can use a mix of dictation
               and speech commands. This works well because the user knows to pause before and after
               commands, and commands are usually at least two words long. So, for instance, a user
               might say a bit of dictation, such as "the small boat", then pause, and say a command
               to delete that dictation, such as "Delete Line". In contrast, if the user were to
               say the two phrases together without a pause, the whole phrase would come out as dictation
               (i.e., "the small boat delete line"). Although speech input programs often include
               modes that listen only for dictation or only for commands, most speech users use the
               all-encompassing mode all the time because it is a much more efficient workflow. It
               could decrease command efficiency significantly if users were to change to command
               mode and back before and after issuing each command.
            </p>
            <p>Speech users can also speak most keyboard commands (e.g., "press Control Foxtrot")
               without any problems. If the website or app is keyboard enabled, the speech user can
               also write a native speech macro that calls the keyboard command, such as "This Print"
               to carry out Ctrl+P.
            </p>
            <p>Single-key shortcuts are the exception. While using single letter keys as controls
               might be appropriate and efficient for many keyboard users, single-key shortcuts are
               disastrous for speech users. The reason for this is that when only a single key is
               used to trip a command, a spoken word can become a barrage of single-key commands
               if the cursor focus happens to be in the wrong place.
            </p>
            <p>For example, a speech-input user named Kim has her cursor focus in the main window
               of a web mail application that uses common keyboard shortcuts to navigate ("k"), archive
               ("y") and mute messages ("m"). A coworker named Mike enters her office and says "Hey
               Kim" and her microphone picks that up. The Y of "hey" archives the current message.
               K in "Kim" moves down one conversation and M mutes a message or thread. And, if Kim
               looks up and says "Hey Mike" without remembering to turn off the microphone, the same
               three things happen in a different sequence.
            </p>
            <p>A user interacting with a webpage or web app that doesn't use single-character shortcuts
               doesn't have this problem. Inadvertent strings of characters from the speech application
               are not interpreted as shortcuts if a modifier key is required. A speech user filling
               in a text input form may find that a phrase that is accidentally picked up by the
               speech microphone results in stray text being entered into the field, but that is
               easily seen and undone. The Resources section of this page contains links to videos
               demonstrating these types of issues.

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Speech users will be able to turn off single-key shortcuts so they can avoid accidentally
                  firing batches of them at once. This will allow speech users to make full use of programs
                  that offer single-key shortcuts to keyboard users.
               </li>
               
               <li>Keyboard-only users who have dexterity challenges can also be prone to accidentally
                  hitting keys. Those users would be able to avoid problematic single character shortcuts
                  by turning them off or modifying them to include at least one non-character key.
               </li>
               
               <li>Allowing <em>all</em> shortcut keys to be remapped can help users with some cognitive disabilities, since
                  the same shortcuts can be assigned to perform the same actions across different applications.
               </li>

               <p>A mechanism is provided to allow users to disable character-key shortcuts. The character
                  key shortcuts are not the only way to carry out these commands. A speech user disables
                  the shortcuts and can prevent words that are picked up by the microphone from triggering
                  single-key shortcuts.

               <p>A keyboard-only user is in a long issues thread. While reading the thread she accidentally
                  hits the S key, which moves focus to the search bar at the top of the document. This
                  causes her to lose her place and her train of thought. However, a mechanism is provided
                  to allow users to change character-key shortcuts. She changes the shortcut to include
                  another key so she can avoid future interruptions.
