         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#error-suggestion" style="font-weight: bold;">3.3.3 Error Suggestion</a> (Level AA): If an <a href="#dfn-input-error">input error</a> is automatically detected and suggestions for correction are known, then the suggestions
            are provided to the user, unless it would jeopardize the security or purpose of the
            content.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users receive appropriate suggestions
               for correction of an input error if it is possible. The WCAG 2.0 definition of "input
               error" says that it is "information provided by the user that is not accepted" by
               the system. Some examples of information that is not accepted include information
               that is required but omitted by the user and information that is provided by the user
               but that falls outside the required data format or allowed values.
               
            </p>
            <p>Success Criterion 3.3.1 provides for notification of errors. However, persons with
               cognitive limitations may find it difficult to understand how to correct the errors.
               People with visual disabilities may not be able to figure out exactly how to correct
               the error. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, users may abandon the form
               because they may be unsure of how to correct the error even though they are aware
               that it has occurred. 
               
            </p>
            <p>The content author may provide the description of the error, or the user agent may
               provide the description of the error based on technology-specific, programmatically
               determined information.

               <li>Providing information about how to correct input errors allows users who have learning
                  disabilities to fill in a form successfully. Users who are blind or have impaired
                  vision understand more easily the nature of the input error and how to correct it.
                  People with motion impairment can reduce the number of times they need to change an
                  input value.

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.

                     products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of
                     you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet
