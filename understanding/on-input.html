            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that entering data or selecting
               a form control has predictable effects. Changing the setting of any user interface
               component is changing some aspect in the control that will persist when the user is
               no longer interacting with it. So checking a checkbox, entering text into a text field,
               or changing the selected option in a list control changes its setting, but activating
               a link or a button does not. Changes in context can confuse users who do not easily
               perceive the change or are easily distracted by changes. Changes of context are appropriate
               only when it is clear that such a change will happen in response to the user's action.

                  <p>This Success Criterion covers changes in context due to changing the setting of a
                     control. Clicking on links or tabs in a tab control is activating the control, not
                     changing the setting of that control.

               <li>This Success Criterion helps users with disabilities by making interactive content
                  more predictable. Unexpected changes of context can be so disorienting for users with
                  visual disabilities or cognitive limitations that they are unable to use the content.

                  <p>Individuals who are unable to detect changes of context are less likely to become
                     disoriented while navigating a site. For example:
                     
                     
                  </p>

                     <li>Individuals who are blind or have low vision may have difficulty knowing when a visual
                        context change has occurred, such as a new window popping up. In this case, warning
                        users of context changes in advance minimizes confusion when the user discovers that
                        the back button no longer behaves as expected. 
                        
                        
                     </li>

                  others who have difficulty interpreting visual cues may benefit from additional cues
                  in order to detect changes of context.

               <li>
                  A form is provided for creating calendar entries in a Web based calendaring and scheduling
                  application. Along with the standard fields for subject, time and location, there
                  is a set of radio buttons to select the type of calendar entry to create.  The calendar
                  entry type can be meeting, appointment or reminder.  If the user selects the radio
                  for meeting, additional fields are displayed on the page for entering the meeting
                  participants. Different fields appear if the reminder button is chosen. Because only
                  parts of the entry change and the overall structure remains the same the basic context
                  remains for the user.

               <li>
                  A form contains fields representing US phone numbers. All of the numbers have a three
                  digit area code followed by a three digit prefix and finally a four digit number,
                  and each part of the phone number is entered into a separate field. When the user
                  completes the entry of one field the focus automatically moves to the next field of
                  the phone number. This behavior of phone fields is described for the user at the beginning
                  of the form.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
