  <h2>Intent of Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</h2>
  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the item receiving keyboard focus is always visible in the user's viewport. For sighted people who rely on a keyboard (or on a device that operates through the keyboard interface, such as a switch or voice input), knowing the current point of focus is critical. The component with focus signals the interaction point on the page. Where users cannot see the item with focus, they may not know how to proceed, or may even think the system has become unresponsive.</p>
  <p>Typical types of content that can overlap focused items are sticky footers, sticky headers, and non-modal dialogs. As a user tabs through the page, these layers of content can hide the item receiving focus, along with its focus indicator.</p>
  <p>A notification implemented as sticky content, such as a cookie banner, will fail this Success Criterion if it partially covers a component receiving focus. Ways of passing include making the banner modal so the user has to dismiss the banner before navigating through the page, or using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap/#propdef-scroll-padding">scroll padding</a> so the banner does not overlap other content. Notifications that do not require user action could also meet this criterion by closing on loss of focus.</p>
  <p>Another form of obscuring can occur where light boxes or other semi-opaque effects overlap the item with focus. This form of obscuring is <em>not</em> in scope for this Success Criterion. While less than 100 percent opacity is not causing the component to be <q>visually hidden</q>, such semi-opaque overlaps may cause a failure of <a href="non-text-contrast">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a> and/or <a href="focus-appearance">2.4.13 Focus Appearance</a>. When a focus indicator can be covered by a semi-opaque component, the focus indicator should be assessed against 1.4.11 and 2.4.13. The intention in both situations is that the component receiving focus should never be obscured to the point a user cannot tell which item has focus.</p>

<section id="benefits">
  <h2>Benefits of Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sighted users who rely on a keyboard interface to operate the page will be able to see the component which gets keyboard focus. Such users include those who rely on devices which use the keyboard interface, including speech input, sip-and-puff software, on-screen keyboards, scanning software, and a variety of assistive technologies and alternate keyboards.</li>
    <li>People with limited or low vision but who rely upon a pointing device (for viewport orientation and repositioning) benefit from a clearly visible indication of the current point of keyboard interaction, especially where magnification reduces the overall useable portion of content.</li>
    <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in executive processes benefit by being able to more easily discover where the focus is located.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="examples">
  <h2>Examples of Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A page has a sticky footer (attached to the bottom of the viewport). When tabbing down the page the focused item is not at all obscured by the footer because content in the viewport scrolls up to always display the item with keyboard focus using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap/#propdef-scroll-padding" rel="nofollow">scroll padding</a>.</li>
    <li>A page has a large (30% wide) cookie approval dialog. The dialog is modal, preventing access to the other controls in the page until it has been dismissed. Focus is not obscured because the cookie approval dialog (including the focus indicator) remains on screen until selections are made and submitted.</li>
    <li>A notification is implemented as a sticky header and the keyboard focus is moved to the notification. The notification disappears when it loses focus, and does not obscure any other controls (including the focus indicator visible prior to the notification).</li>
  </ul>

  <section id="failure">
    <h3>Failures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An interaction that causes content to appear over the component with keyboard focus, visually covering part of the focus indicator. This behavior might be encountered with advertising or promotional material meant to provide more information about a product as the user navigates through a catalogue.</li>
      <li>A page has a sticky footer (attached to the bottom of the viewport). When tabbing down the page, a focused item is partially obscured by the footer because content in the viewport scrolls without sufficient <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap/#propdef-scroll-padding" rel="nofollow">scroll padding</a>.</li>
