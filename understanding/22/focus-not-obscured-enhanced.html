        <h2>Intent of Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to ensure that a component with keyboard focus is visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="./focus-not-obscured.html">Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)</a> but requires that the whole of the component is visible.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Focus  Not Obscured</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>This Success Criterion helps anyone who relies on the keyboard to operate the page by letting them visually determine the component on which keyboard operations will interact at any point in time.</li>
         <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.</li>
