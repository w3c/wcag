            <p class="note">Targets that allow for values to be selected spatially based on position within the target are considered one target for the purpose of the success criterion.

            <p class="note">For inline targets the line-height should be interpreted as perpendicular to the flow of text. For example, in a language displayed vertically, the line-height would be horizontal.</p>

    <section id="intent">
        <h2>Intent of Target Size (Minimum)</h2>

        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help ensure targets can be easily activated without accidentally activating an adjacent target. When targets are small, it is difficult for users with hand tremors and those who have difficulty with fine motor movement to activate them accurately when there are other targets that are too close. Providing sufficient size, or sufficient spacing between targets, will reduce the likelihood of accidentally activating the wrong control.</p>

        <p>This Success Criterion defines a <em>minimum</em> size and, if this can't be met, a minimum spacing; using larger sizes will help many people use targets more easily. Meeting <a href="../21/target-size-enhanced.html">2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)</a> is recommended whenever possible.</p>

        <section id="exceptions">
            <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <p>The requirement is for targets to be at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels in size. There are five exceptions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the <a>bounding box</a> of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target.</li>
                <li><strong>Equivalent:</strong> In cases where a target does not have a size equivalent to 24 by 24 CSS pixels, but there is another control that can achieve the underlying function that <em>does</em> meet the minimum size, the target can be excepted based on the "Equivalent" exception.</li>
                <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The Success Criterion does not apply to inline targets in sentences, or where the size of the target is constrained by the line-height of non-target text. This exception is allowed because text reflow based on viewport size makes it impossible for authors to anticipate where links may be positioned relative to one another. When multiple links are embedded in blocks of texts in smaller text sizes, guaranteeing that undersized links in adjacent lines of text at least fulfill the spacing exception (their 24 CSS pixel diameter circle don't intersect any other links or their circles) would require a large line height which can be undesirable in many design contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>User agent control:</strong> Browsers have default renderings of some controls, such as the days of the month calendar in an <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code>. As long as the author has not modified the user agent default, the target size for a "User agent control" is excepted.</li>
                <li><strong>Essential:</strong> If the spacing of the targets is essential to the information being conveyed, the "Essential" exception applies. For example, in digital maps, the position of pins is analogous to the position of places shown on the map. If there are many pins close together, the spacing between pins and neighboring pins will often be below 24 CSS pixels. It is essential to show the pins at the correct map location, therefore the Essential exception applies. Also, some jurisdictions legally require online forms to replicate paper forms, which can impose constraints on the size of targets. In such jurisdictions, any legal requirement to replicate small targets can be considered essential.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Size requirement</h3>

            <p>For a target to be "at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels", it must be possible to draw a solid 24 by 24 CSS pixel square, aligned to the horizontal and vertical axis such that the square is completely within the target (does not extend outside the target's area).</p>

            <figure id="target-size-basic">
                <img src="img/target-size-basic.svg" width="180" height="75" alt="Three square boxes next to each other, each with a height and width of 24px" />
                <figcaption>Where targets are a 24 by 24px square (and larger is better), they meet the size requirement of the criterion and pass (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-size-basic.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The 24 by 24px square has to be aligned with the page, although the target itself could be skewed.</p>

            <figure id="target-size-skewed">
                <img src="img/target-size-skewed.svg" width="130" height="120" alt="A skewed rectangle that includes a 24 by 24px square within it." />
                <figcaption>So long as there is a solid 24 by 24px square within the target, it meets the size requirement of the criterion and passes (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-size-skewed.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>If a target is not large enough to allow for a 24 by 24px square to be drawn inside it, it is considered <em>undersized</em>, and does not pass the size requirement of the Success Criterion. However, if it has sufficient space around it without adjacent targets, it may still pass the criterion thanks to the spacing exception (below).</p>

            <figure id="target-size-undersized-rounded">
                <img src="img/target-size-undersized-rounded.svg" width="250" height="105" alt="A circle with a diameter of 24px, but not filling up a 24px square." />
                <figcaption>The rounded corners do not leave sufficient space to draw a 24 by 24px square inside the target, making the target <em>undersized</em>. Depending on the spacing to other targets, it may still pass if it has sufficient clearance (image shown at 1:1 and 2:1 scale - <a href="img/target-size-undersized-rounded.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The requirement is independent of the zoom factor of the page; when users zoom in the CSS pixel size of elements does not change. This means that authors cannot meet it by claiming that the target will have enough spacing or sufficient size if the user zooms into the page.</p>
        
            <p>The requirement does not apply to targets while they are obscured by content displayed as a result of a user interaction or scripted behavior of content, for example:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>interacting with a combobox shows a dropdown list of suggestions</li>
                <li>activating a button displays a modal dialog</li>
                <li>content displays a cookie banner after page load</li>
                <li>content displays a "Take a survey" dialog after some period of user inactivity</li>
            </ul>    
            <p>The requirement does however apply to targets in any new content that appears on top of other content.</p>

            <p>While the Success Criterion primarily helps touch users by providing target sizing to prevent accidental triggering of adjacent targets, it is also useful for mouse or pen users. It reduces the chances of erroneous activation due to either a tremor or reduced precision, whether because of reduced fine motor control or input imprecision.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="spacing">
            <h3>Spacing</h3>

            <p>When the minimum size for a target is not met, spacing can at least improve the user experience. There is less chance of accidentally activating a neighboring target if a target is not immediately adjacent to another. Touchscreen devices and user agents generally have internal heuristics to identify which link or control is closest to a user's touch interaction - this means that sufficient spacing between targets can work as effectively as a larger target size itself.</p>

            <p>The following example shows a horizontal row of icon-based buttons. In the top row, the dimensions of each target are 24 by 24 CSS pixels, passing this Success Criterion. In the second row, the same targets are only 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have a 4 CSS pixel space between them – as the target size is below 24 by 24 CSS pixels, these need to be evaluated against the Success Criterion's spacing exception, and they pass. In the last row, the targets are again 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have no space between them – these fail the spacing exception, because when drawing the 24 CSS pixel diameter circles over the targets, the circles intersect.</p>

            <figure id="target-spacing-toolbar">
                <img src="img/target-spacing-toolbar.svg" width="560" height="265" alt="Three rows showing a horizontal toolbar of icon-based controls with measurements. In the first row, the targets have a dimension of 24 by 24 CSS pixels, so pass. In the second row, the same toolbar is shown again, but overlaid with the 24 CSS pixel circles – the circles don't intersect, so pass. In the last row, the toolbar is shown again with the circles, but the circles intersect, so fail." />
                <figcaption>Three rows of targets, illustrating two ways of meeting this Success Criterion and one way of failing it (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-spacing-toolbar.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The next two illustrations show sets of buttons which are only 16 CSS pixels tall. In the first set, there are no targets immediately above or below the buttons, so they pass. In the second illustration, there are further buttons, and they have been stacked on top of one another, resulting in a fail.</p>
            <figure id="target-text-buttons-one-row">
                <img src="img/target-text-buttons-single-row.svg" width="785" height="105" alt="A row of buttons which are more that 44px wide and 16 CSS pixels high. There are no close targets above or below." />
                <figcaption>The widths of the buttons with adjacent neighbors is above 24 CSS pixels, while the height is only 16 CSS pixels. However, the lack of adjacent targets above and below means that the targets pass this Success Criterion (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-text-buttons-single-row.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure id="target-text-buttons-two-rows">
                <img src="img/target-text-buttons-two-rows.svg" widht="785" height="105" alt="Two rows of buttons only 16 CSS pixels high, with no spacing between them." />
                <figcaption><strong>Fail:</strong> Two rows of buttons, both with a height of only 16 CSS pixels. The rows are close, with only a 1 CSS pixel gap between them, which means that the 24 CSS pixel spacing circles of the targets in one row will intersect the targets (and their circles, depending on their respective widths) in the other line, thus failing the Success Criterion (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-text-buttons-two-rows.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The following two illustrations show how menu items can be adjusted to properly meet this requirement. In the first illustration, the <q>About us</q> menu has been activated, showing that each of the menu item targets (text and padding) has a 24 CSS pixel height. In the second illustration, the same menu is expanded, but the menu items only achieve 18 CSS pixels in height.</p>
            <figure id="target-dropdown">
                <img src="img/target-dropdown.svg" width="690" height="210" alt="Two examples of a dropdown menu - a pass example with menu items 24 CSS pixels high, and a fail example with menu items only 18 CSS pixels high. One item has a 24 CSS pixel circle which intersects adjacent targets." />
                <figcaption>A dropdown menu is shown. The PASS example has menu items which are 24 CSS pixels high. In the FAIL example, the menu items are only 18 CSS pixels high, meaning that the 24 CSS pixel spacing circles of the targets in one row will intersect the adjacent menu item targets and circles (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-dropdown.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The following example has one large target (an image that links to a new page related to that image) and a very small second target (a control with a magnifier icon, to open a zoomed-in preview, possibly in a modal, of the image itself). In the top row, the small target overlaps - or, to be more technically accurate, clips - the large target. The small target itself has a size of 24 by 24 CSS pixels, so passes. In the second row, we see that if the second target is any smaller – in this case 16 by 16 CSS pixels – it fails the criterion, as the circle with a 24 CSS pixel diameter we draw over the small target will intersect the large target itself.</p>

            <figure id="target-large-small-clipping">
                <img src="img/target-large-small-clipping.svg" width="460" height="320" alt="Two rows showing a small target clipping a large target" />
                <figcaption>Two rows with a small target clipping (overlapping) a large target. In the first row, the 24 by 24 CSS pixel small target passes. In the second row, the 16 by 16 CSS pixel small target fails, since the 24 CSS pixel diameter circle used for undersized targets intersect the large target (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-large-small-clipping.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>In the following example, we have the same two targets – a large target and a small target. This time, the small target touches/abuts the large target. If the small target is smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels, the circle with a 24 CSS pixel diameter we draw over the small target will intersect the large target itself, failing the requirement. The undersized target must be spaced further away from the large target until its circle doesn't intersect the large target.</p>

            <figure id="target-large-small-touching">
                <img src="img/target-large-small-touching.svg" width="460" height="320" alt="Two rows showing a small target and a large target touching/abutting" />
                <figcaption>In the first row, the 16 by 16 CSS pixel target touching/abutting the large target fails, as its 24 CSS pixel diameter circle used for undersized targets intersects the large target. In the second row we see that the only way the undersized target can pass is by adding a 4 CSS pixel spacing gap between the targets (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-large-small-touching.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="note">Users with different disabilities have different needs for control sizes. It can be beneficial to provide an option to increase the active target area without increasing the visible target size. Another option is to provide a mechanism to control the density of layout and thereby change target size or spacing, or both. This can be beneficial for a wide range of users. For example, users with visual field loss may prefer a more condensed layout with smaller sized controls while users with other forms of low vision may prefer large controls.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Target Size (Minimum)</h2>
        <p>Having targets with sufficient size - or at least sufficient target spacing - can help all users who may have difficulty in confidently targeting or operating small controls. Users who benefit include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People who use a mobile device where the touch screen is the primary mode of interaction;</li>
            <li>People using mouse, stylus or touch input who have mobility impairments such as hand tremors;</li>
            <li>People using a device in environments where they are exposed to shaking such as public transportation;</li>
            <li>Mouse users who have difficulty with fine motor movements;</li>
            <li>People who access a device using one hand;</li>
            <li>People with large fingers, or who are operating the device with only a part of their finger or knuckle.</li>

    <section id="examples">
        <h2>Examples of Target Size (Minimum)</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Three buttons are on-screen and the target size of each button is 24 by 24 CSS pixels. Since the target size itself is 24 by 24 CSS pixels, no additional spacing is required, the Success Criterion passes.</li>
            <li>A row of buttons, each of which has a horizontal width of more than 24 CSS pixels, a height of only 20 CSS pixels, and vertical margin of 4 CSS pixels above and below the row of buttons. Since there is sufficient spacing both above and below the row of buttons, the Success Criterion passes.</li>
            <li>Links within a paragraph of text have varying target dimensions. Links within paragraphs of text do not need to meet the 24 by 24 CSS pixels requirements, so the Success Criterion passes.</li>
