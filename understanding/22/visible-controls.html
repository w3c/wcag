        <h2>Intent of Visible Controls</h2>

		<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that controls needed to progress or complete a process can be easily found by people with cognitive disabilities when they are needed.</p>

		<p>People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find controls needed to progress if they are hidden until focus is placed on them or a pointer hovers over them. They may also not remember where the control is the next time they interact with the site. Additionally, some methods for exposing hidden controls (such as mouse-over) may not be supported by all platforms or user-agents.</p>

		<p>Some design approaches hide controls needed to complete tasks and require certain user interactions, such as mouse-over, to display these controls. These required interactions can leave users with cognitive disabilities without a path forward.</p>

		<h3>When Needed</h3>
		<p>Controls should be visible without user interaction (i.e., persistently visible) when they are needed. Not all controls must be visible all the time, if there is another control that achieves the same task and is visible, that would meet an exception. In multi-step processes or multipart forms, the control may be hidden in an earlier step/part, however, at the time the user can move forward the control needs to be persistently visible without having interacted with the control.  Similarly, this SC does not require inactive controls to be persistently visible until the user is able to progress. For example, when a form includes required fields be completed before the submit button becomes active, the submit button does not need to be persistently visible while it is inactive.</p> 

		<p>When multiple controls are included in a single location, some indication of those controls such as a drop down indicator should be visible without user interaction. </p>

		<p>In some cases, controls are provided in multiple locations on a page or at multiple points within a process. In these cases, at least one of the instances of the controls needs to be visible without user interaction.  For example, in an email process, some controls such as trash may be visible using pointer hover in the list of emails but are always visible on the view of the email itself. Because the controls are persistently visible on the email view, they do not need to persistently visible on the list of emails.</p>

		<h3>Visible</h3>
		<p>The intent of this SC is to help individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities locate controls they need to successfully complete their desired task.  The controls addressed in this SC should also meet the SC for sufficient text (1.4.3/1.4.6) and non-text (1.4.11) contrast. </p>

		<h3>Embedded Controls</h3>
		<p>Components such as video players, web chats, and carousels often include controls that are only visible on hover since they overlay the contents being displayed.  The presence of the component (or the static placeholder picture for a video) is considered to be the "Information needed to identify user interface components", like the top visible part of a drop-down that shows sub-items. Some users may still struggle if media controls are not persistently visible, so there is benefit to providing a mechanism for people to keep the controls visible.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Visible Controls</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>Users with cognitive and learning disabilities can more easily locate controls that allow them to successfully progress through a process.</li>
         <li>Users with memory impairments do not need to remember where controls are located</li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Visible Controls</h2>

      <ul>
         <li><strong>Web Editor Success</strong>: In a web editor, once a page is open for editing, all the possible locations for editing display a pencil icon.</li>
         <li><strong>Web Editor Success</strong>: In a web editor, the possible locations for editing are hidden until a user hovers over them but a radio button in settings can be changed so that the icons are all shown by default. </li>
         <li><strong>Email Success</strong>: When writing an email, controls needed to delete or forward the email are hidden by hover on the email list page but visually persist at the top of the email screen.</li>         
      </ul>
