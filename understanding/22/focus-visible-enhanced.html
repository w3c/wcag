        <blockquote>
        <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
        
        <p>When a <a>User Interface Component</a> receives keyboard <a>focus</a>, all of the following are true:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a>focus indication area</a> is greater than or equal to the longest side of the bounding rectangle of the focused control, times 2 <a>CSS pixels</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus contrast:</strong> Color changes used to indicate focus have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with the colors changed from the unfocused control.</li>
            <li><strong>Contrast or thickness:</strong> The focus indication area has a 3:1 contrast ratio against all adjacent colors for the minimum area or greater, or has a thickness of at least 2 CSS Pixels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">A focus indicator that is larger than the minimum area may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>

        <h2>Intent of Focus Visible (Enhanced)</h2>


        <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is clearly visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="../20/focus-visible.html">SC 2.4.7 focus visible</a> and defines a minimum level of visibility.</p>

        <p>For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard-like device (e.g. a switch, voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. Visible focus must also meet the needs of low-vision users, who may also be keyboard-only users.</p>
            
        <p>A keyboard focus indicator can take different forms, this success criterion sets a requirement to make it is clearly distinguishable.</p>
            
        <section id="keyboard-focus">
            <h3>Keyboard focus</h3>
            <p>The keyboard focus is the point of interaction for someone using a keyboard. For environments with a keyboard operable interface, the keyboard focus can be moved around the interface in order to interact with different elements. Whichever element is being interacted with has focus.</p>

            <p>In web pages some components may receive focus as a user presses the tab key to move to that component and then use the arrow keys to select an option (e.g. tabs, menu items). The item considered to be focused is whichever is being interacted with. For example, if you tab to a menu and arrow-down to a menu item, it is the menu item that is in focus as pressing enter would activate the menu item.</p>

            <p>Some elements can take focus (such as the target of a skip link), however, it is only when the element is operable by keyboard controls that this criterion applies.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="size-of-indicator">
            <h3>Size of the indicator</h3>

            <p>The bigger the visible change the easier it is for someone to see, authors are encouraged to make the change as large as possible. For example, a thick outline around the element.</p>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-strong">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-strong.png" alt="Three links on a white background with the middle one encompassed in a thick black border." width="250" />
                <figcaption>A strong indicator around a link.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>To determine the minimum size for conformance purposes you would need to measure the size of the element.</p>

            <p class="note">A <a>CSS pixel</a> is what developers use in CSS declarations like “width: 200px”, it is device-independent and not to be confused with device pixels which vary depending on the physical pixel density. <br />
                The rest of this document notates CSS pixels as "px".
            </p>

            <p>To establish if a focus indicator has a size equivalent to at least a 2px line along the longest side: If a link is 90px wide by 30px tall, the indicator would need to be have a minimum area of 180px square. (I.e. 2px wide along the longest side is 2 x 90px.)</p>

            <p>The following 3 examples use a 90px wide by 30px tall button, therefore the surface area requirement is 180px. The middle button is focused in each example.</p>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-innerline">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-innerline.png" alt="Three dark blue buttons on a white background. The middle button has a yellow inner border." width="284" />
                <figcaption>The inner outline is slightly smaller than the outer edge of the component, but using a 2px thick indicator means it is well over the minimum requirement of 180px squared.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-underline">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-underline.png" alt="Three dark blue buttons on a white background. The middle button has a thick yellow line under the text." width="284" />
                <figcaption>The thick (3px) yellow underline is almost as long as the longest edge therefore meets the requirment.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-icon">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-icon.png" alt="Three dark blue buttons on a white background. The middle button has a yellow square to the left of the text." width="284" />
                <figcaption>The 14px by 14px yellow square is 196px therefore meets the requirment.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>If controls change size across different variations of a page (e.g. in a responsive design), it helps to use a proportionally sized indicator such as an outline or background change. In that way you can be sure of meeting the size requirement.</p>

            <p>If controls change size and you use a fixed size indicator (such as an icon of a fixed size) you would need to calculate the largest size a control could be in order to provide an indicator that meets the size requirement across variations.</p>

            <p>Typical focus indicators:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An outline around the whole component would pass the size requirement;</li>
                <li>Changing the background of a control would pass the size requirement;</li>
                <li>A 1px wide vertical line (such as a blinking cursor) would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement, a text input would need a larger or separate focus indicator.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you need to use complex mathematics to work out if a focus indicator is large enough, it is probably a sign that you should use a larger and proportional indicator that will provide a more visible indicator.</p>

            <section id="unsual-shapes">
                <h4>Unusual shapes and gradients</h4>

            
                <p>If you have an unusal shape, some mathematics may be required if the focus indicator is on the edge of the size requirement. For example, if the focusable control is a circle with a diameter of 100px, the bounding box of that component would be a square of 100px on each side. If the focus indicator is also circular, then the area needs to 100px * 2 = 200px.</p>

                <figure id="focus-indicator-circle">
                    <img src="img/focus-indicator-circle.png" alt="Two orange circlular buttons with an icon in the middle. The right hand circle has a dark outline around the whole cicle to indicate focus" width="150" />
                    <figcaption>A circular button in the default state, and then with a focus indicator.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The circumference of a 100px diameter circle would be 314px (diameter * π), therefore a 1px outline around the cicle will be 314px of surface area, meeting the requirement for a 200px surface area.</p>

                <p>If a focus indicator is an irregular shape, such as a drop-shadow under a star icon, it helps if the contrasting area is obviously quite large.</p>

                <figure id="focus-indicator-star-shadow">
                    <img src="img/focus-indicator-star-shadow.png" alt="Two yellow star symbols, the second has a dark drop-shadow." width="400" />
                    <figcaption>The default and focused states of a star component.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>What is the contrasting area of the drop shadow? The quick method is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look at the size of the component, and imagine a box around it, how long is the longest edge?</li>
                    <li>Look at the (contrasting) area of the focus indicator.</li>
                    <li>Mentally compare the focus indicator to the length of the longest edge * 2px.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If it is too close to call, you could extract the contrasting area of the focus indicator and evaluate the surface area.</p>

                <p>If a focus indicator has a gradient, the principle is to measure the contrast of the changed area, and ignore the change that does not me 3:1.</p>
                <figure id="focus-indicator-box-shadow">
                    <img src="img/focus-indicator-box-shadow.png" alt="Three buttons, the middle with a heavy drop-shadow indicating focus." />
                    <figcaption>When a gradient is used on a focus indictor, the measure of surface area should only include the area that has changed enough to meet the 3:1 contrast ratio.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>If you take some spot-checks on the gradient area and establish what area meets the contrast, it is straightforward to work out if that area is sufficient.</p>
                <figure id="focus-indicator-box-shadow-only">
                    <img src="img/focus-indicator-box-shadow-only.png" alt="The middle button with the drop-shadow included, but the subtle grey areas removed to only show the contrasting area." />
                    <figcaption>The focused button with the non-contrasting areas removed, showing that it is a thick indicator that meets the requirements.</figcaption>
                </figure>

        <section id="Contrast-thickness">
            <h3>Contrast or thickness</h3>

            <p>Where a control is a solid color, and you add a border or outline of a very similar color, it is difficult to perceive the change to the control.</p>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-thin-non-contrast">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-thin-non-contrast.png" alt="Three dark buttons, the middle one appears very slightly larger due to a thin dark outline." width="255" />
                <figcaption>Adding a 1px dark outline around a dark button does not differentiate it, this example <strong>fails</strong> the success criteria.</figcaption>
            </figure>
                    
            <p>The requirement is to have an indicator that has a 3:1 contrast ratio with the adjacent colors (including the component), or to be separated from the component, or to be at least 2px thick.</p>

                <img src="img/focus-indicator-thick-non-contrast.png" alt="Three dark buttons, the middle one appears larger due to a thick dark outline." width="255" />

                <figcaption>Adding an outline that is separated from the button helps to differentiate which one is focused.</figcaption>

        <section id="change-of-color">
            <h3>Change of color</h3>

            <p>The greater the change of contrast between states the easier it is for users to see it. Authors are encouraged to make the change of color contrast as great as possible.</p>

            <p>When a component changes to include a focus indicator, that change can always be measured as a change of color contrast. For example, if a yellow outline is added to a button on a blue background, the change of color is from blue to yellow.</p>
                    
            <p class="note">Color contrast measurements in WCAG are based on luminance (brightness) regardless of the hue.</p>

                <img src="img/focus-indicator-innerline.png" alt="Three dark blue buttons on a white background. The middle button has a yellow inner border." width="284" />
                <figcaption>Adding a yellow outline to a link is a change of color from blue to yellow. That change has a contrast ratio of 12:1.</figcaption>
            </figure>        

                    
            <p>Text and non-text contrast measures use adjacent colors, this success criterion measures the <em>change</em> in color between non-focused and focused states.</p>

            <figure id="focus-indicator-non-contrast">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-non-contrast.png" alt="Three buttons with light background and dark border on a white backround. The middle button has a light grey outline." width="250" />
                <figcaption>The second link has a light-grey (#ccc) focus outline which <strong>fails</strong> this success criterion because the change from white-background to light-grey outline does not meet 3:1.</figcaption>
            </figure>

        <section id="relation-non-text-color-contrast">
            <h3>Relation to non-text color contrast</h3>
            <p><a href="non-text-contrasast" class="sc">Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-text contrast</a> requires that a UI component maintains contrast across it’s states, including when focused. For example, a checkbox must contrast with its adjacent colors, and the check within the checkbox must contrast with its adjacent colors. </p>
            
            <p>Focus-visible (enhanced) requires that the change of color contrast for the focus indicator (only) has contrast compared to the non-focused component.</p>
            
            <figure id="focus-indicator-checkboxs">
                <img src="img/focus-indicator-checkboxs.png" alt="Four checkboxes. Unchecked is a plain box. Focused has a circular line outside. Checked is dark green with a white tick. Focused and checked also has a dark green circle around it." width="400" />
                <figcaption>Four checkboxes in different combinations of checked and focused. The circular indicators (lines) provide a sufficient change of color contrast.</figcaption>
           </figure>
           
            <p>In the example above:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The checkbox has sufficient contrast with its adjacent background in default, focused, checked, and checked-focused states; </li>
                <li>The check (tick) within the checkbox contrasts with its adjacent color; </li>
                <li>The circular outline around the checkbox that indicates focus has a sufficient <em>change</em> of contrast.</li>

                <figcaption>A default checkbox and a focused checkbox. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The contrast of the default checkbox passes 1.4.11 because the dark border and white background have a contrast ratio greater than 3:1. The 2px dark blue focus outline passes Focus Visible (Enhanced) because the change of contrast is greater than 3:1 with the white background. The component as a whole maintains contrast with the white background so continues to pass 1.4.11.</p>
