        <h2>Focus Appearance (Enhanced) Success Criteria text</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <h4>Focus Appearance (Enhanced)</h4>
    
            <p>When <a>user interface components</a> have keyboard focus, all of the following are true:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a>focus indicator</a> is double the area of a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> perimeter of the unfocused component;</li>
               <li><strong>Change of contrast:</strong> The pixels making up the minimum focus indicator area achieve at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio between their colors in the focused and unfocused states.</li>
               <li><strong>Not obscured:</strong> No part of the focus indicator is hidden by author-created content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>

        <h2>Intent of Focus Appearance (Enhanced)</h2>


        <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is highly visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="./focus-appearance-minimum.html">Success Criterion 2.4.11 Focus Appearance (Minimum)</a> and defines a higher level of visibility for the focus indicator.</p>

        <p>In relation to Focus Visible (enhanced) this criterion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expands the minimum area to 2 CSS pixels around the perimeter.</li>
            <li>Increases the change of contrast to 4.5:1.</li>
            <li>Does not allow for any part of the element to be obscured by other content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The other aspects of the success criterion are the same as Focus Visible (Minimum).</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>Benefits of Focus Appearance (Enhanced)</h2>
      <p>The benefits of this success criterion are similar to Focus Appearance (Minimum).</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Sighted keyboard users can visually determine which component will be interacted with using keyboard operations.</li>
         <li>People with low vision are better able to follow a highly visible focus indicator.</li>
         <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.</li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Focus Visible</h2>
      <p>The examples of this success criterion are similar to Focus Appearance (Minimum).</p>
      <ul>
         <li>When links receive focus, an outline is displayed around the link that contrasts with the background adjacent to the link.</li>
         <li>When buttons receive focus, and outline is displayed within the button (around the text) that contrasts with the button’s background.</li>
         <li>When text fields receive focus, an outline is displayed around the field, indicating that the input has focus.</li>  
         <li>When radio buttons receive focus, an outline is displayed around the control, indicating that the input has focus.</li>        
      </ul>
