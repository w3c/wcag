        <h2>Intent of Dragging Movements</h2>


        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure functionality that uses a dragging movement (e.g. sliders, drag-and-drop interfaces) has another <a href="#dfn-single-pointer">single pointer</a> mode of operation without the need for the dexterity required to drag elements.</p>

        <p>Some people cannot perform dragging motions in a precise manner. Others use a specialized or adapted input device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled mouse emulator, which makes dragging cumbersome, error-prone, or outright impossible.</p>
            
        <p>When an interface implements functionality that uses dragging motions, some users can tap or click, but not accurately maintain contact whilst performing a dragging motion. An alternative method must be provided so that users with mobility impairments that use a pointer (mouse, pen, or touch contact) can use the functionality.</p>
		
     <p>Success Criteria 2.1.1 Keyboard and 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) require dragging features to be keyboard accessible; however, it is possible to create an interface that works with dragging and keyboard controls that does not work using only clicks or taps.</p>

    <p>This Success Criterion applies to dragging motions as opposed to pointer gestures, which are covered in Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures. Pointer gestures include directional path-based as well as multi-point gestures. In contrast, for dragging motions, only the start and end point of the motion matters, not the actual path.</p>

      <p>There may be cases where a dragging movement is essential, for example, drawing a freeform figure, or playing a game where the aim is to follow a particular track as accurately as possible. The criterion has an exception for these cases where the task requires dragging.</p>

      <p>Some tasks may typically involve dragging, such as sorting items in a list, but as there are other ways to achieve that task they are not considered essential.</p>
      
      <h3>Distinguishing dragging movements from path-based pointer gestures</h3>
      
      <p>Dragging movements covered in this Success Criterion are pointer interactions where only the endpoints matter. Once the pointer engages with a target, the direction of the dragging motion does not factor into the interaction until the pointer disengages the target. Since the dragging movement does not have an intermediate point, the dragging motion can go in any direction.</p> 
      
      <p>Path-based gestures covered in Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures are pointer interactions that involve at least an initial directionality. The pointer motion must include at least one intermediate point to qualify as a path-based gesture. The intermediate point defines the motion as a gesture by requiring a specific path, even when the entire path to complete the interaction is not predefined. While a user may use dragging movements to perform the interaction, path-based gestures requires following a path to an intermediate point.

      <h2>Benefits of Dragging Movements</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>Users who struggle with performing dragging motions can still operate an interface with a pointer interface.</li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Dragging Movements</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>A sortable list of elements may, after focussing a list element, provide adjacent controls for moving the element up or down in the list by simply tapping/clicking on those controls.</li>
         <li>A kanban implementation may provide an additional pop-up menu for focused elements that can be activated by simple clicks/taps providing an option for moving the selected element to another kanban silo.</li>
         <li>A radial control widget where the value can be set by dragging includes a text field that presents the current value and offers the input of the desired value via a keyboard (including on-screen virtual keyboards).</li>  
         <li>A map allows users to drag the view of the map around, and the map has up/down/left/right buttons to move the view as well.</li>
