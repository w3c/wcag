            <p>A <a>cognitive function test</a> (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless that step provides at least one of:</p> 
            <dl>
                <dt>Alternative</dt>
                <dd>Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.</dd>

        <h2>Cognitive function test definition</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A task that requires the user to remember, manipulate, or transcribe information. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>memorization, such as remembering a username, password, set of characters, images, or patterns. The common identifiers name, e-mail, and phone number are not considered cognitive function tests as they are personal to the user and consistent across websites;</li>
                <li>transcription, such as typing in characters;</li>
                <li>remembering or transcribing a word;</li>
                <li>recognizing a picture, phrase or sound the website provided</li>
                <li>recognizing an object</li>
                <li>use of correct spelling;</li>
                <li>performing calculations;</li>
                <li>solving of puzzles.</li>

        <h2>Intent of Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to ensure there is an accessible, easy-to-use, and secure method to log in, access content, and undertake tasks. This criterion is the same as <a href="accessible-authentication">Accessible Authentication</a> but without the exceptions for objects and user-provided content.</p>

        <p>Any required step of the authentication process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cannot display a selection of images, videos, or audio clips, where users must choose which image they provided;</li>
            <li>cannot display a selection of images, where users must choose the images which contain a specific object, such as a car.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>Benefits of Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)</h2>
      
        <p>The benefits of this success criterion are the same as <a href="accessible-authentication.html#benefits">Accessible Authentication</a>.</p>

      <p>People with cognitive issues relating to memory, reading (for example, dyslexia), numbers (for example, dyscalculia), or perception-processing limitations will be able to authenticate irrespective of the level of their cognitive abilities.</p>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)</h2>
      <p>The examples of this Success Criterion are the same as the <a href="accessible-authentication.html#examples">Accessible Authentication</a> examples.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A web site uses a properly marked up username (or email) and password fields as the login authentication (meeting <a href="identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a> and <a href="name-role-value">Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value</a>). The user's browser or integrated third-party password manager extension can identify the purpose of the inputs and automatically fill in the username and password.</li>
        <li>A web site does not block paste functionality. The user is able to use a third-party password manager to store credentials, copy them, and paste them directly into a login form.</li>
        <li>A web site uses WebAuthn so the user can authenticate with their device instead of username/password. The user's device could use any available modality. Common methods on laptops and phones are facial-scan, fingerprint, and PIN (Personal Identification Number). The web site is not enforcing any particular use, it is assumed a user will setup a method that suits them.</li>
        <li>A web site offers the ability to login with a third-party provider using the OAuth method.</li>
        <li>A web site that requires two-factor authentication allows for multiple options for the 2nd factor, including a USB-based method where the user simply presses a button to enter a time-based token.</li>
        <li>A web site that requires two-factor authentication displays a QR code which can be scanned by an app on a user's device to confirm identity.</li>
        <li>A web site that requires two-factor authentication sends a notification to a user's device. The user must use their device's authentication mechanism (for example, user-defined PIN, fingerprint, facial recognition) to confirm identity.</li>
      </ul>
