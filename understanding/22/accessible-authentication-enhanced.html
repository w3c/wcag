        <h2>Intent of Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure there is an accessible, easy-to-use, and secure method to log in, access content, and undertake tasks. This criterion is the same as <a href="accessible-authentication-minimum">Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</a> but without the exceptions for objects and user-provided content.</p>

        <p>Any required step of the authentication process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cannot display a selection of images, videos, or audio clips, where users must choose which image they provided;</li>
            <li>cannot display a selection of images, where users must choose the images which contain a specific object, such as a car.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Benefits of Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)</h2>

        <p>The benefits of this success criterion are the same as <a href="accessible-authentication-minimum.html#benefits">Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</a>.</p>

      <p>People with cognitive issues relating to memory, reading (for example, dyslexia), numbers (for example, dyscalculia), or perception-processing limitations will be able to authenticate irrespective of the level of their cognitive abilities.</p>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)</h2>

      <p>The examples of this success criterion are very similar to the <a href="accessible-authentication-minimum.html#examples">Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</a> examples.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A website uses a properly marked up username (or email) and password fields as the login authentication (meeting <a href="identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a> and <a href="name-role-value">Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value</a>). The user's browser or integrated third-party password manager extension can identify the purpose of the inputs and automatically fill in the username and password.</li>
        <li>A website does not block paste functionality. The user is able to use a third-party password manager to store credentials, copy them, and paste them directly into a login form.</li>
        <li>A website uses WebAuthn so the user can authenticate with their device instead of username/password. The user's device could use any available modality. Common methods on laptops and phones are facial-scan, fingerprint, and PIN (Personal Identification Number). The website is not enforcing any particular use; it is assumed a user will set up a method that suits them.</li>
        <li>A website offers the ability to login with a third-party provider using the OAuth method.</li>
        <li>A website that requires two-factor authentication allows for multiple options for the 2nd factor, including a USB-based method where the user simply presses a button to enter a time-based token.</li>
        <li>A website that requires two-factor authentication displays a QR code which can be scanned by an app on a user's device to confirm identity.</li>
        <li>A website that requires two-factor authentication sends a notification to a user's device. The user must use their device's authentication mechanism (for example, user-defined PIN, fingerprint, facial recognition) to confirm identity.</li>
      </ul>
