        <h2>Intent of Target Size (Minimum)</h2>

        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure targets can be easily activated without accidentally activating an adjacent target. When targets are small, it is difficult for users with hand tremors and those who have difficulty with fine motor movement to activate them accurately. Providing a minimum size of 24 x 24 CSS pixels (which can include spacing between targets if the target itself is smaller) will reduce the likelihood of accidentally activating the wrong control.</p>  

        <p>There are five exceptions where targets can be smaller than 24 x 24 pixels:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> The offset between adjacent targets is at least 24 CSS pixels, where the offset is measured from the farthest point of one target to the nearest point of each adjacent target including spacing. The offset includes the vertical or horizontal target dimension plus the spacing of targets to any adjacent target. For example, a target of 20 x 20px would meet the requirement if it had a spacing of 2px on all sides. If the target is 24 x 24px or larger, no spacing between it and adjacent targets would be required.</p></li>
          <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The target is in a sentence or block of text. There are cases when links in blocks of text cannot easily meet the requirement unless a large line height would be applied, which may be disadvantageous for other reasons. A list of text links where entire list items are linked would not fall under this exception.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous region:</strong> The target is one of a range of continuous targets within a single focusable region. For some targets such as slider controls, the activation of a particular spot within the target may present an easy option for pointer users to set the value of the control. When continuous regions such as the groove of a slider control can process pointer input, they are treated as one target in terms of this success criterion.</li>
          <li><strong>Equivalent function:</strong> The target’s function is achievable through another component that has a target area of at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels. In cases where design constraints mean that the minimum target size cannot be achieved, the requirement can be met by an equivalent function where the target size is 24 x 24px (or falls under one of the other exceptions). An example would be a drop-down menu with more menu items than would fit into the vertical space of a typical reference display if each target would be given a height of 24px. The success criterion would be met if the same menu options were offered in a pop-up or footer-based site map that meets the target size requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Essential:</strong> A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed. In some contexts, the size or proximity of  targets is constrained, for example, when targets represent a spatial position. An example are pin icons on a digital map. Here, it is essential that the pins show the actual location on the map faithfully, even if this means that they may be very close or overlap.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The requirement is independent of the zoom factor of the page; when users zoom in the CSS pixel size of elements does not change. This means that authors cannot meet it by claiming that the target will have enough spacing or sufficient size if the user zooms into the page.</p>

        <p>The requirement does not apply to the spacing of targets inside unstyled native elements. For example, when a default select element is used, the vertical spacing of option elements inside the selects dropdown list is exempt.</p>

        <p>While the Success Criterion primarily helps touch users by ensuring that activation with the 'fat finger' will not accidentally trigger adjacent targets, it is also useful for mouse or pen users. It reduces the chances of erroneous activation due to a tremor or some other input imprecision.</p>
      
        <p>As mobile devices generally have internal heuristics to identify which link is closest, spacing can work as effectively as a larger target size.</p>

            <figcaption>In the top line of icons, the dimension of each icon target is 44 by 44 CSS pixels with no space in between, amply passing this Success Criterion. In the next row, the dimension of each icon target is 24 by 24 CSS pixels with no space in between, passing this Success Criterion. In the next row, the the same icon targets are only 20 x by 20 CSS pixels but they have 4px space inbetween, passing this Success Criterion. In the last row, the the same icon targets are only 20 x by 20 CSS pixels and have no space inbetween, failing this Success Criterion. </figcaption>

            <figcaption>The widths of the button with adjacent neighbors is above 24 CSS pixels, while the height is only 22 CSS pixels. However, the target height combined with the vertical spacing above and below exceeds 24 CSS pixels, therefore, the targets pass this Success Criterion.</figcaption>

        <figure id="pointer-target-44-20-nospace">
            <img src="img/pointer-target-example4a.png" alt="A row of buttons only 20 px high, with other targets flush below, and only 2px spacing above." />   
            <figcaption><strong>Fail:</strong> Two rows of buttons, all with a height of only 20 CSS pixels. In the top row, buttons all have sufficient width (above 24px). For the top row, targets below are flush, with no gap. The gap to the links above is only 2px wide. Therefore, the buttons in the top row fail the Success Criterion. </figcaption>

            <figcaption>A dropdown menu is shown. The PASS example has menu items which are 24 px high. In the FAIL example, the menu items are only 20 px high.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Where targets are embedded inside other targets, the inner target either needs a size of at least 44 x 44 CSS pixels or must be placed at the edge or corner to make sure that there is sufficient adjacent spacing in each dimension.</p>

        <figure id="pointer=target-embedded">
            <img src="img/pointer-target-example5.png" alt="Three examples of a target adjacent to, or nested within another target (see legend below)" />
          <figcaption>Three examples of a person's profile image, which is supposed to be a target leading to another page, and a magnifying glass icon, which is supposed to open a lightbox view of the profile image. In the first example, the magnifying icon is outside the picture with sufficient spacing and passes. In the second example, the icon overlaps with the top-left corner of the image, but passes due to sufficient spacing top and left. In the third example, the icon sits inside the linked image. Since it is surrounded by an active click area, the icon target is not large enough to pass the Success Criterion.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
        <p>Users with different disabilities have different needs for control sizes. It can be beneficial to provide an option to increase the active target area without increasing the visible target size. Another option is to provide a mechanism to control the density of layout and thereby change target size or spacing, or both. This can be beneficial for a wide range of users. For example, users with visual field loss may prefer a more condensed layout with smaller sized controls while users with other forms of low vision may prefer large controls.</p>
      
      <p>Where user-agents control the size of a target, such as the options in a <code>select</code> drop-down, and the author has not changed the size of target with size or padding adjustments, the target is exempted from this criterion. It would be beneficial for users if the minimum size &amp; spacing requirement is met, but where the user-agent has defined the target it is not the author's responsibility.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Target Size (Minimum)</h2>
      <p>Having targets with sufficient size or spacing can help all users who may have difficulty in confidently targeting or operating small controls. Users who benefit include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users who use a mobile device where the touch screen is the primary mode of interaction;</li>
        <li>Users with mobility impairments such as hand tremors;</li>
       <li>Users who use a device in environments where they are exposed to shaking such as public transportation;</li>
       <li>Users who have difficulty with fine motor movements;</li>
       <li>Users who access a device using one hand;</li>
       <li>Users with large fingers, or who are operating the device with only a part of their finger or knuckle.</li>
     </ul>

        <h2>Examples of Target Size (Minimum)</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Three buttons are on-screen and the target area of each button is 24 by 24 CSS pixels. Since the target size itself is 24 x 24 px, no additional spacing is required, the Success Criterion passes.</li>
            <li>A row of buttons, each of which has a horizontal width of more than 50px, but a height of only 20 px. Since there is sufficient spacing above and below the row of buttons, the Success Criterion passes.</li>
            <li>Links within a paragraph of text have varying target dimensions. Links within paragraphs of text do not need to meet the 24 by 24 CSS pixels requirements, so the Success Criterion passes.</li>
