            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that functionality is predictable
               as visitors navigate their way through a document. Any component that is able to trigger
               an event when it receives focus must not change the context.          Examples of
               changing context when a component receives focus include, but are not limited to:
               
               
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>forms submitted automatically when a component receives focus;</li>
               
               
               <li>new windows launched when a component receives focus;</li>
               
               
               <li>focus is changed to another component when that component receives focus;</li>
               
               
            </ul>
            <p>Focus may be moved to a control either via the keyboard (e.g. tabbing to a control)
               or the mouse (e.g. clicking on a text field). Moving the mouse over a control does
               not move the focus
               unless scripting implements this behavior. Note that for some types of controls, clicking
               on a control may also activate the control (e.g. button), which may, in turn, initiate
               a change in context.

                     the field.

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
