            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that functionality is predictable
               as visitors navigate their way through a document. Any component that is able to trigger
               an event when it receives focus must not change the context.          Examples of
               changing context when a component receives focus include, but are not limited to:
               
               
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>forms submitted automatically when a component receives focus;</li>
               
               
               <li>new windows launched when a component receives focus;</li>
               
               
               <li>focus is changed to another component when that component receives focus;</li>
               
               
            </ul>
            <p>Focus may be moved to a control either via the keyboard (e.g. tabbing to a control)
               or the mouse (e.g. clicking on a text field). Moving the mouse over a control does
               not move the focus
               unless scripting implements this behavior. Note that for some types of controls, clicking
               on a control may also activate the control (e.g. button), which may, in turn, initiate
               a change in context.

                     choice and either hits the escape or the tab key to move out of the pulldown menu
                     – it does not jump to a new screen as the focus shifts out of the dropdown menu.

                     When a field receives focus, a help dialog window describing the field and providing

                     the keyboard focus away from the control every time the user attempts to tab past
                     the field.
