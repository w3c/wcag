            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by prerecorded
               audio-only and prerecorded video-only content available to all users. Alternatives
               for time-based media that are text based make information accessible because text
               can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile)
               to match the needs of the user. In the future, text could also be translated into
               symbols, sign language or simpler forms of the language (future).
               
            </p>
            <p>An example of pre-recorded video with no audio information or user interaction is
               a silent movie. The purpose of the transcript is to provide an equivalent to what
               is presented visually. For prerecorded video content, authors have the option to provide
               an audio track. The purpose of the audio alternative is to be an equivalent to the
               video. This makes it possible for users with and without vision impairment to review
               content simultaneously. The approach can also make it easier for those with cognitive,
               language and learning disabilities to understand the content because it would provide
               parallel presentation.

                  <p>A text equivalent is not required for audio that is provided as an equivalent for
                     video with no audio information.  For example, it is not required to caption video
                     description that is provided as an alternative to a silent movie.
