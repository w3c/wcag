            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion (SC) is to ensure that when people override author
               specified text spacing to improve their reading experience, content is still readable
               and operable. Each of the requirements stipulated in the SC's four bullets helps ensure
               text styling can be adapted by the user to suit their needs.
            </p>
            <p>The specified metrics set a minimum baseline. The values in between the author's metrics
               and the metrics specified in this SC should not have loss of content or functionality.
            </p>
            <p>This SC focuses on the adaptability of content to an increase in spacing between lines,
               words, letters, and paragraphs. Any combination of these may assist a user with effectively
               reading text. As well, ensuring that content correctly adapts when users override
               author settings for spacing also significantly increases the likelihood other style
               preferences can be set by the user. For example, a user may need to change to a wider
               font family than the author has set in order to effectively read text. 
            </p>
            <section id="author-responsibility-">
               
               <h3>Author Responsibility </h3>
               
               <p>This SC does not dictate that authors must set all their content to the specified
                  metrics. Rather, it specifies that an author's content has the ability to be set to
                  those metrics without loss of content or functionality. The author requirement is
                  both to not interfere with a user's ability to override the author settings, and to
                  ensure that content thus modified does not break content in the manners shown in figures
                  1 through 3 in Effects of Not Allowing for Spacing Override. The values in the SC
                  are a baseline. Authors are encouraged to surpass the values specified, not see them
                  as a ceiling to build to. If the user chooses to go beyond the metrics specified any
                  resulting loss of content or functionality is the user's responsibility.
               </p>
               
               <p>Further, this SC is not concerned with <em>how</em> users change the line height and spacing metrics. It does not require that content
                  implement its own mechanisms to allow users to do this. It is not a failure of the
                  content if a user agent or platform does not provide a way for users to do this. Content
                  does not fail this SC if the method chosen by the user - for instance, the use of
                  an extension or bookmarklet - fails to correctly set the line height and spacing text
                  properties on the content (provided that the content is not actively and purposely
                  preventing the properties from being added).
               </p>
               
               <section id="applicability">
                  
                  <h4>Applicability</h4>
                  
                  <p>If the markup-based technologies being used are capable of overriding text to the
                     Success Criterion's metrics, then this SC is applicable. For instance Cascading Style
                     Sheet/HTML technologies are quite able to allow for the specified spacing metrics.
                     Plugin technologies would need to have a built-in ability to modify styles to the
                     specified metrics. Currently, this SC does not apply to PDF as it is not implemented
                     using markup.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Examples of text that are typically not affected by <a href="#dfn-style-property">style properties</a> and not expected to adapt are:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Video captions embedded directly into the video frames and not provided as an associated
                        caption file
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><a href="#dfn-image-of-text">Images of text</a></li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>For this SC, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element">canvas</a> implementations of text are considered to be <a href="#dfn-image-of-text">images of text</a>.

               <h3>User Responsibility</h3>
               
               <p>The ability to read and derive meaning from the overridden spacing rests with the
                  user. The user may choose to exceed the spacing adjustments in the SC. If the increased
                  spacing causes loss of content or functionality, the user will adjust or return to
                  the author’s original spacing or spacing within the bounds of the SC. Regardless,
                  the user needs the flexibility to adjust spacing within the bounds set in the SC without
                  loss of content or functionality. Such changes may be achieved via user stylesheet,
                  bookmarklet, extension, or application.

McLeish found an increasing curve in reading
                  speed of actual materials up to .25, but it  started to flatten at .20. Previous studies
                  that reported no improvement started at .5em. Right at the flat point.  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-low-vision-a11y-tf/2017Jun/0047.html">Wayne E.

                     <dt>Word Spacing </dt>
                     
                     <dd>Words were spaced farther apart. In languages that do not have words (e.g. Japanese)
                        applying word spacing had no effect. This is expected.
                     </dd>
                     
                     <dt>Line Height</dt>
                     
                     <dd>Changing line height did not separate diacritics from characters, nor did it adversely
                        impact ascenders or descenders.
                     </dd>

                     or script. In such cases, authors are only required  to ensure  relevant  properties
                     do not break the layout.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
