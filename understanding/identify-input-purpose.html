            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the purpose of a form input
               collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined, so that
               user agents can extract and present this purpose to users using different modalities.
               The ability to programmatically declare the specific kind of data expected in a particular
               field makes filling out forms easier, especially for people with cognitive disabilities.
            </p>
            <p>Appropriate visible labels and instruction can help users understand the purpose of
               form input fields, but users may benefit from having fields that collect specific
               types of information be rendered in an unambiguous, consistent, and possibly customized
               way for different modalities - either through defaults in their user agent, or through
               the aid of assistive technologies.
            </p>
            <p>For some input fields, the type attribute already offers a way to broadly specify
               the intention of the input field, for example, input type="tel", input type="email",
               or input type="password". However, these are only very broad categories, describing
               the type of input, but not necessarily its purpose, especially as it relates to user-specific
               input fields. As an example, type="email" indicates that the field is for an e-mail
               address but does not clarify if the purpose is for entering the user's e-mail address
               or some other person's e-mail.
            </p>
            <p>This success criterion defines the types of user interface component input purposes,
               found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes">Section 7 of the WCAG 2.1 Recommendation</a>, that must be programmatically identifiable. When these user input purposes are present,
               and if the technology supports doing so, the field purpose must be programmatically
               identifiable.
            </p>
            <p>The HTML autocomplete attribute only accepts a certain number of specific well-defined
               fixed values. This allows a more fine-grained definition or identification of purpose
               than the type attribute, for example, by allowing the author to specify a specific
               type of name: Name (autocomplete="name”), Given Name (autocomplete="given-name”),
               Family Name (autocomplete="family-name”), as well as Username (autocomplete="username”),
               and Nickname (autocomplete="nickname”).
            </p>
            <p>By adopting and repurposing this predefined taxonomy of definitions, user agents and
               assistive technologies can now present the purpose of the inputs to users in different
               modalities. For example, assistive technologies may display familiar icons next to
               input fields to help users who have difficulties reading. An icon of a birthday cake
               may be shown in front of an input field with autocomplete="bday", or the icon of a
               telephone in front of an input field with autocomplete="tel".
            </p>
            <p>In addition to repurposing this taxonomy, when the autocomplete attribute technique
               is used to meet this Success Criterion, browsers and other user agents can suggest
               and 'autofill' the right content by autocompleting these fields based on past user
               input stored in the browser. By defining more granular definitions of common input
               purposes, for example “Birthday” (autocomplete=”bday”), browsers can store personalized
               values for each of these fields (the user's birthday date). The user is relieved of
               having to type the information and can instead confirm or, if needed, change the value
               of the field, a significant benefit for users with memory issues, dyslexia, and other
               disabilities. Because the autocomplete values are independent of language, users that
               may not be familiar with the text used to visually identify user input fields (the
               label) can still have that purpose consistently identified to them due to the fixed
               taxonomy of terms.
            </p>
            <p>If an input field accepts two different types of input purpose (as in combined user
               name/user email fields) and the technology used does not allow multiple purpose values
               to be defined, it is valid to provide either one or the other value or leave out the
               designation of input purpose altogether.
            </p>
            <p>When the user agent and assistive technology support for other metadata formats matures,
               metadata schemes like the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/personalization-semantics/content/">Personalization Semantics Content Module</a> may be used in addition or instead of the HTML autocomplete attribute to identify
               the purpose of input fields. They can also support automated adaptations that identify
               and match author-provided input labels to defined vocabularies or symbols that are
               used instead for labelling inputs.

                  this Success Criterion, which means information does not need to be remembered by

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
