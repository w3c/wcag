            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid consequences
               that may result from making a mistake when submitting form data. This criterion builds
               on 
               <a href="error-prevention-legal-financial-data" class="guideline">Success Criterion 3.3.4</a> in that it applies to all forms that require users to submit information. 
               
            </p>
            <p>Users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes and may have more difficulty
               detecting or recovering from mistakes. People with reading disabilities may transpose
               numbers and letters, and those with motor disabilities may hit keys by mistake. Providing
               the ability to reverse actions allows users to correct a mistake. Providing the ability
               to review and correct information gives the user an opportunity to detect a mistake
               before taking an action.
