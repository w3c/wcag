            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to further reduce the chance of seizures.
               Seizures cannot be completely eliminated since some people are so sensitive.  However,
               by eliminating all 3-per-second flashing over any area of the screen, the chances
               of a person having a seizure are further reduced than when just meeting the measures
               ordinarily used today in standards internationally, as we do at Level A. 
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Whereas 
               <a href="three-flashes-or-below-threshold" class="guideline">Success Criterion 2.3.1</a> allows flashing if it is dim enough or has a small enough area, Success Criterion
               2.3.2 does not allow flashing greater than 3 per second, regardless of brightness
               or size. As a result, even a single flashing pixel would violate this criterion. The
               intent is to guard against flashing larger than a single pixel, but since an unknown
               amount of magnification or high contrast setting may be applied, the prohibition is
               against any flashing.

                  <p>In some cases, what we refer to as "blinking" and what we refer to as "flashing" may
                     overlap slightly.  We are using different terms for the two because "blinking" causes
                     a distraction problem which you can allow for a short time as long as it stops (or
                     can be stopped) whereas "flashing" is a seizure trigger and cannot be allowed or it
                     will cause a seizure. The seizure would occur faster than most users could turn it
                     off.  "Blink" therefore refers to slow repeating changes that would distract.  "Flash"
                     refers to changes that could cause a seizure if they were bright enough or persisted
                     long enough. Blinking usually doesn't occur at speeds of 3 per second or more so blink
                     and flash do not overlap. However, blinking can occur faster than 3 per second so
                     there could be an overlap. See 
                     <a href="pause-stop-hide">2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide</a> for more information on blink.
