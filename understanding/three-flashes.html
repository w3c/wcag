            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to further reduce the chance of seizures.
               Seizures cannot be completely eliminated since some people are so sensitive.  However,
               by eliminating all 3-per-second flashing over any area of the screen, the chances
               of a person having a seizure are further reduced than when just meeting the measures
               ordinarily used today in standards internationally, as we do at Level A. 
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Whereas 
               <a href="three-flashes-or-below-threshold" class="guideline">Success Criterion 2.3.1</a> allows flashing if it is dim enough or has a small enough area, Success Criterion
               2.3.2 does not allow flashing greater than 3 per second, regardless of brightness
               or size. As a result, even a single flashing pixel would violate this criterion. The
               intent is to guard against flashing larger than a single pixel, but since an unknown
               amount of magnification or high contrast setting may be applied, the prohibition is
               against any flashing.

                  <p>In some cases, what we refer to as "blinking" and what we refer to as "flashing" may
                     overlap slightly.  We are using different terms for the two because "blinking" causes
                     a distraction problem which you can allow for a short time as long as it stops (or
                     can be stopped) whereas "flashing" is a seizure trigger and cannot be allowed or it
                     will cause a seizure. The seizure would occur faster than most users could turn it
                     off.  "Blink" therefore refers to slow repeating changes that would distract.  "Flash"
                     refers to changes that could cause a seizure if they were bright enough or persisted
                     long enough. Blinking usually doesn't occur at speeds of 3 per second or more so blink
                     and flash do not overlap. However, blinking can occur faster than 3 per second so
                     there could be an overlap. See 
                     <a href="pause-stop-hide">2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide</a> for more information on blink.

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
