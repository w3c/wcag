            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to access the full content
               of a site without inducing seizures due to photosensitivity.
               
            </p>
            <p>Individuals who have photosensitive seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered
               by content that flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes. People
               are even more sensitive to red flashing than to other colors, so a special test is
               provided for saturated red flashing. These guidelines were originally based on guidelines
               for
               the broadcasting industry as adapted for desktop monitors, where content is viewed
               from a closer distance (using a larger angle of vision).
               
            </p>
            <p>Flashing can be caused by the display, the computer rendering the image or by the
               content being rendered. The author has no control of the first two. They can be addressed
               by the design and speed of the display and computer. The intent of this criterion
               is to ensure that flicker that violates the flash thresholds is not caused by the
               content itself. For example, the content could contain a video clip or animated image
               of a series of strobe flashes, or close-ups of rapid-fire explosions.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion replaces a much more restrictive criterion in WCAG 1.0 that
               did not allow any flashing (even of a single pixel) within a broad frequency range
               (3 to 50 Hz). This Success Criterion is based on existing specifications in use in
               the UK and by others for television broadcast and has been adapted for computer display
               viewing. In WCAG 2.0, a 1024 x 768 screen was used as the reference screen resolution
               for the
               evaluation. The 341 x 256 pixel block represents a 10 degree viewport at a typical
               viewing distance. (The 10 degree field is taken from the original specifications and
               represents the central vision portion of the eye, where people are most susceptible
               to photo stimuli.)
               
            </p>
            <p>With the proliferation of devices of varying screen sizes (from small hand-helds to
               large living room displays), as well as the adoption of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-css-pixels">CSS pixels</a> as a density-independent unit of measurement, the prior assessment criteria may seem
               outdated. However, an image of a consistent size uses up relatively the same percentage
               of a user's visual field on any device. On a large screen, the image takes up less
               size, but the large screen takes up a larger part of the visual field. On a mobile
               screen, the image may take up most or all of the screen; however, the mobile screen
               itself takes up a smaller portion of the user's visual field. So the same dimension
               of the flashing content, represented in CSS pixels can still provide a consistent
               means of assessment. Substituting CSS pixels for the original pixel block means that
               the combined area of flashing becomes 341 x 256 CSS pixels, or a flashing area of
               87,296 CSS pixels.
            </p>
            <p>Content should be analyzed at the largest scale at which a user may view the content,
               and at the standard zoom level of the user agent. For example, with a video that may
               play in an area of a web page and also at full screen, the video should be analyzed
               for risks at full screen.
            </p>
            <p>Where video content is provided in color spaces other than sRGB, the version provided
               with the highest dynamic range should be tested. In such cases the industry standard
               definition of a general flash is a change in luminance of 20 cd/m2 or more where the
               darker image is below 160 cd/m2. (<a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.1702/">ITU-R BT.1702</a>.) This is applicable for standard dynamic range (SDR) and high dynamic range (HDR)
               content. For HDR content when the darker state is 160 cd/m2 or more, a general flash
               is one where the Michelson contrast is 1/17 or greater — where the Michelson contrast
               is calculated as (LHigh - LLow) / (LHigh + LLow), and where LHigh and LLow are the
               luminance of the high and low luminance states, respectively.
            </p>
            <p>For short clips that might be looped (such as GIF animations), the content should
               be analyzed while looping. 
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>The specification cannot account for the actual viewing distance that a person chooses.
                  Users that are closer to their screens than the idealized viewing distance will be
                  affected by flashing areas that normatively pass. The same problem applies to users
                  who rely on zoom or screen magnification. Conversely, users who are further away from
                  the screen than the idealized distance should be able to tolerate flashing areas that
                  are larger than the threshold.

            <p>The combined area of flashes occurring concurrently and contiguously means the total

               contiguous area that is flashing simultaneously within any 10 degree angle of view.

                     <li>"Flashing" refers to content that can trigger a seizure (if it is more than 3 per
                        second and large and bright enough). This cannot be allowed even for a second or it
                        could cause a seizure. And turning the flash off is also not an option since the seizure
                        could occur faster than most users could turn it off.

                        blinking occurs faster than 3 per second, it would also be considered a flash.

                     with a value R/(R + G + B) that is greater than or equal to 0.8, and the difference
                     between states is more than 0.2 (unitless) in the CIE 1976 UCS chromaticity diagram.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
