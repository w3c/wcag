            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make users aware of important changes in
               content that are not given focus, and to do so in a way that doesn't unnecessarily
               interrupt their work.
            </p>
            <p>The intended beneficiaries are blind and low vision users of assistive technologies
               with screen reader capabilities. An additional benefit is that assistive technologies
               for users with cognitive disabilities may achieve an alternative means of indicating
               (or even delaying or supressing) status messages, as preferred by the user.
            </p>
            <p>The scope of this Success Criterion is specific to changes in content that involve
               status messages. A <a href="#dfn-status-message">status message</a> is a defined term in WCAG. There are two main criteria that determine whether something
               meets the definition of a status message:
            </p>
            <ol>
               		
               <li> the message <q>provides information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting
                     state of an application, on the progress of a process, or on the existence of errors;</q></li>
               		
               <li> the message is not delivered via a change in context.</li>
               	
            </ol>
            <p>Information can be added to pages which does not meet the definition of a status message.
               For example, the list of results obtained from a search are not considered a status
               update and thus are not covered by this Success Criterion. However, brief text messages
               displayed <em>about</em> the completion or status of the search, such as "Searching...", "18 results returned"
               or "No results returned" would be status updates if they do not take focus. Examples
               of status messages are given in the section titled <a href="#status-examples">Status Message Examples</a> below.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion specifically addresses scenarios where new content is added
               to the page without changing the user's context. <a href="#dfn-changes-of-context">Changes of context</a>, by their nature, interrupt the user by taking focus. They are already surfaced by
               assistive technologies, and so have already met the goal to alert the user to new
               content. As such, messages that involve changes of context do not need to be considered
               and are not within the scope of this Success Criterion. Examples of scenarios that
               add new content by changing the context are given in the section titled <a href="#excepted-examples">Examples of Changes That Are Not Status Messages</a> below.
            </p>

         <section id="benefits">
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
               					
               <li>When appropriate roles or properties are assigned to status messages, the new content
                  is spoken by screen readers in such a way as to assist blind and low vision users.
                  Most sighted users can observe text peripherally added to the viewport. Such content
                  provides additional information without affecting the user's current point of regard.
                  The ability of an assistive technology to announce such new important text content
                  allows more users to benefit from an awareness of the information in an equivalent
                  manner.
               </li>
               			
               <li>Assigning proper roles or properties to status messages provides possible future uses
                  and personalization opportunities, such as the potential to be exploited by assistive
                  technologies created for users with some cognitive disabilities. Where page authors
                  elect to design additions to the screen which do <em>not</em> change the user's context (i.e., take focus), the information is arguably of less
                  importance than something presented using a modal dialog, which must be acknowledged
                  by the user. As such, depending on the user's preferences, an assistive technology
                  may choose to delay, suppress, or transform such messages so a user is not unnecessarily
                  interrupted; or conversely the assistive technology may highlight such messages where
                  the user finds it optimal to do so.

                  <li>After a user presses a Search button, the page content is updated to include the results
                     of the search, which are displayed in a section below the Search button. The change
                     to content also includes the message "5 results returned" near the top of this new
                     content. This text is given an appropriate role for a status message. A screen reader
                     announces, "Five results returned".
                  </li>
                  				
                  <li>After a user presses an Add to Shopping Cart button, a section of content near the
                     Shopping Cart icon adds the text "5 items". A screen reader announces "Five items"
                     or "Shopping cart, five items".
                  </li>
                  				
                  <li>After a user enters incorrect text in an input called Postal Code, a message appears
                     above the input reading "Invalid entry".  The screen reader announces, "Invalid entry"
                     or "Postal code, invalid entry".
                  </li>
                  				
                  <li>After a user activates a process, an icon symbolizing 'busy'  appears on the screen.
                     The screen reader announces "application busy". 
                  </li>
                  				
                  <li>An application displays a progressbar to indicate the status of an upgrade. The element
                     is assigned a suitable role. The screen reader provides intermittent announcements
                     of the progress.

                  </li> 
                  		        
                  <li>After a user unsuccessfully fills in a form because some of the data is in the incorrect
                     format, text is added to the existing form which reads "5 errors on page". The screen
                     reader announces the same message.

                  <li>After a user puts a photo in an album in an online photo app, a <a href="https://material.io/design/components/snackbars.html#">snackbar </a> displays the message "Saved in 'Wedding' album", which is also read by a screen reader.

               <h3>Examples of Status Messages that Do Not Add New Text to the Screen</h3>
               			
               <p>This Success Criterion was intentionally worded to apply primarily when visible text
                  is added to (or becomes visible on) the page. The reason for this is that where new
                  text is displayed, it is intended to be visible to all users. By providing a programmatic
                  means of ensuring the text is also surfaced through assistive technologies, the Success
                  Criterion provides the same information to users who cannot or may not see it. However,
                  not all changes to content involve the addition of text to the screen. The following
                  are all considerations relevant to this Success Criterion:
               </p>
               				
               <ul>
                  					
                  <li>Non-displayed text specific to AT users;</li>
                  
                  
                  <li>Modification of status text;</li>
                  
                  <li>Removal of status text; and</li>
                  
                  <li>Non-textual status content, such as images.</li>
                  				
               </ul>
               				
               <section id="non-displayed-text-specific-to-at-users">
                  		
                  <h4>Non-displayed text specific to AT users</h4>
                  		
                  		
                  <p>There may be cases where the addition of visible text does not by itself convey sufficient
                     information to the user of assistive technology. For example, the proximity of new
                     content to other pieces of information on the screen may provide a visual context
                     that is lacking in the text alone.
                  </p>
                  		
                  <p>In such cases, authors may wish to designate additional content for inclusion in the
                     status message, including non-displayed text which can be provided to the assistive
                     technologies, for added context. Important considerations regarding the appropriate
                     use of such techniques are further discussed in the Sufficient Techniques.

               <section id="modification-of-status-text">
                  		
                  <h4>Modification of status text</h4>
                  		
                  <p>If a status message persists on the page, modifications to this text are usually equivalent
                     to a new status message. An example would be a shopping cart which updates text from
                     reading "0 items" to "3 items". Typical methods of writing such changes in the page
                     content result in the entire modified text string being considered a new change, and
                     thus read by assistive technologies. However, where only the number in this string
                     was coded as an updated chunk of content, the resulting experience for screen reader
                     users could be to only hear "three", which may not be sufficient information to provide
                     context for the user. In such situations, marking the entire "3 items" string as the
                     status text would normally be a better solution. See Sufficient Techniques for more
                     discussion, including the use of <code>aria-atomic</code>. In this case it would also be a courtesy to add offscreen text such as "in shopping
                     cart" to the message.

                  <h4>Removal of status text</h4>
                  		
                  <p>In situations where status text is entirely removed, its absence may itself convey
                     information about the status. The most obvious example of this is where a message
                     is displayed that the system is "busy" or "waiting". For a sighted user, when this
                     text disappears, it is normally an indication that the state is now available. However
                     non-sighted users would be unaware of this change, unless the end of the waiting state
                     results in a change of context for the user. Where updating the visible message (e.g.,
                     to "system available") is not feasible, the use of a non-visible status message, such
                     as "system available", ensures equivalent status information is provided. See Sufficient
                     Techniques for more discussion.

                     (under SC 1.1.1 Non-Text Content), and 2) the requirement of this current Success
                     Criterion to supply an appropriate role.

                  All cases are excepted from this Success Criterion since they do not meet the definition

                        context is already announced by the screen reader, and thus does not need to be included
                        in the scope of this Success Criterion.

                        as "expanded" or "collapsed," would be announced by the screen reader, and thus the
                        user would be alerted to the 'addition' or 'removal' of content. As such, such content

               <p>Live regions and alerts can be usefully applied in many situations where a change
                  of content takes place which does not constitute a status message, as defined in this
                  Success Criterion. However, there is a risk of making an application too "chatty"
                  for a screen reader user. User testing should be carried out to ensure the appropriate
                  level of feedback is achieved. The Advisory Techniques provide examples of how alerts
                  or live regions can enhance the user experience.

                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
