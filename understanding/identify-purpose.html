            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the purpose of many elements
               on a page can be programmatically determined, so that user agents can extract and
               present that purpose to users using different modalities.
            </p>
            <p>Many users with limited vocabularies rely on familiar terms or symbols in order to
               use the web. However, what is familiar to one user may not be familiar to another.
               When authors indicate the purpose, users can take advantage of personalization and
               user preferences to load a set of symbols or vocabulary familiar to them.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion requires the author to programmatically associate the purpose
               of icons, regions and components (such as buttons, links, and fields) so that user
               agents can determine the purpose of each and adapt indicators or terminology to make
               them understandable for the user. It is achieved by adding semantics or metadata that
               provide this context. It is similar to adding role information (as required by 4.1.2)
               but instead of providing information about what the UI component is (such as an image)
               it provides information about what the component represents (such as a link to the
               home page).
            </p>
            <p>Identifying regions of the page allows people to remove or highlight regions with
               their user agent.
            </p>
            <p>Products for people who are non-vocal often use symbols to help users communicate.
               These symbols are in fact people's language. Unfortunately, many of these symbols
               are both subject to copyright and not interoperable. That means end users can only
               use one device, and cannot use content, apps, or assistive technologies that have
               not been made by a single company.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion enables symbols to be interoperable so that symbol users can
               understand different content that was not just made by one company.  When users' symbols
               are mapped to the same nodes, then user agents can load the user-understandable symbol.
               People can then buy the symbols and use them across different devices or applications.
               (Note that the symbols would still be proprietary, but they could then be interoperable.)

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
