            <p>Individuals who use screen reading software can find it hard to hear the speech output
               if there is other audio playing at the same time. This difficulty is exacerbated when
               the screen reader's speech output is software based (as most are today) and is controlled
               via the same volume control as the sound. Therefore, it is important that the user
               be able to turn off the background sound. Note: Having control of the volume includes
               being able to reduce its volume to zero.

                  <p>Playing audio automatically when landing on a page may affect a screen reader user's
                     ability to find the mechanism to stop it because they navigate by listening and automatically
                     started sounds might interfere with that navigation. Therefore, we discourage the
                     practice of automatically starting sounds (especially if they last more than 3 seconds),
                     and encourage that the sound be 
                     <em>started</em> by an action initiated by the user after they reach the page, rather than requiring
                     that the sound be 
                     <em>stopped</em> by an action of the user after they land on the page.

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
