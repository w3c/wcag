            links to the next web page. The text alternative may say "Go to page 4."
            Naturally, it would not be appropriate to repeat this exact text alternative on the next web page.

            Their functions can be different depending on the context of the web page.
            A check mark icon may function as "approved", "completed", or "included", to name a few, depending on the situation.
            Using "check mark" as text alternative across all web pages does not help users understand the function of the icon.
