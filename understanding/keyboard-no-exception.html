            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that 
               <strong>all</strong> content is operable from the keyboard. This is the same as Success Criterion 2.1.1,
               except that no exceptions are allowed. This does not mean that content where the underlying
               function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just
               the endpoints (excluded from the requirements of 2.1.1) must be made keyboard accessible.
               Rather, it means that content that uses path-dependent input cannot conform to this
               Success Criterion and therefore cannot meet Guideline 2.1 at Level AAA.

            <h2>Techniques</h2>
            <p>Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques
               that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. However,
               it is not necessary to use these particular techniques. For information on using other
               techniques, see <a href="understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a>, particularly the "Other Techniques" section.

                           as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface
                           to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications
                           that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text
                           applications with "keyboard emulation" functionality.
