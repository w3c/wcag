         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#parsing" style="font-weight: bold;">4.1.1 Parsing</a> (Level A): In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end
            tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain
            duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow
            these features.
            
         </p>
         <p class="note">Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such
            as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not
            complete.

         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents, including assistive
               technologies, can accurately interpret and parse content. If the content cannot be
               parsed into a data structure, then different user agents may present it differently
               or be completely unable to parse it. Some user agents use "repair techniques" to render
               poorly coded content. 
               
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Since repair techniques vary among user agents, authors cannot assume that content
               will be accurately parsed into a data structure or that it will be rendered correctly
               by specialized user agents, including assistive technologies, unless the content is
               created according to the rules defined in the formal grammar for that technology.
               In markup languages, errors in element and attribute syntax and
               failure to provide properly nested start/end tags lead to errors that
               prevent user agents from parsing the content reliably.
               Therefore, the Success Criterion requires that the content can be parsed using only
               the rules of the formal grammar.
               
               
            </p>

                  <p>The concept of "well formed" is close to what is required here. However, exact parsing
                     requirements vary amongst markup languages, and most non XML-based languages do not
                     explicitly define requirements for well formedness. Therefore, it was necessary to
                     be more explicit in the success criterion in order to be generally applicable to markup
                     languages. Because the term "well formed" is only defined in XML, and (because end
                     tags are sometimes optional) valid HTML does not require well formed code, the term
                     is not used in this success criterion.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>With the exception of one success criterion (
                     <a href="resize-text">1.4.2: Resize text</a>, which specifically mentions that the effect specified by the success criterion must
                     be achieved without relying on an assistive technology) authors can meet the success
                     criteria with content that assumes use of an assistive technology (or access features
                     in use agents) by the user, where such assistive technologies (or access features
                     in user agents) exist and are available to the user.
