         <p>Guideline <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#text-alternatives" style="font-weight: bold;">1.1 Text Alternatives</a>: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into
            other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler
            language.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that all non-text content is also available
               in 
               <a href="#dfn-text">text</a>. "Text" refers to electronic text, not an image of text. Electronic text has the
               unique advantage that it is presentation neutral. That is, it
               can be rendered visually, auditorily, tactilely, or by any combination. As a result,
               information rendered in electronic text can be presented in whatever form best meets
               the needs of the user. It can also be easily enlarged, spoken aloud so that it is
               easier for people with reading disabilities to understand, or rendered in whatever
               tactile form best meets the needs of a user.

                     is not limited to this use of symbols.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
