            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to minimize the occurrence of content that
               requires timed interaction. This enables people with blindness, low vision, cognitive
               limitations, or motor impairments to interact with content. This differs from the
               Level A Success Criterion in that the only exception is for real-time events.

               <li>People with physical disabilities often need more time to react, to type and to complete
                  activities.  People with low vision need more time to locate things on screen and
                  to read.   People who are blind and using screen readers may need more time to understand
                  screen layouts, to find information and to operate controls.  People who have cognitive
                  or language limitations need more time to read and to understand.  People who are
                  deaf and communicate in sign language may need more time to read information printed
                  in text (which may be a second language for some).
