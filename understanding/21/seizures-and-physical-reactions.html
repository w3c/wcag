      <h2>Intent of Seizures</h2>
      
      
      <p>Some people with seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered by flashing visual
         content. Most people are unaware that they have this disorder until it strikes. In
         1997, a cartoon on television in Japan sent over 700 children to the hospital, including
         about 500 who had seizures. Warnings do not work well because they are often  missed, especially by children
         who may in fact not be able to read them.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The objective of this guideline is to ensure that content that is marked as conforming
         to WCAG 2.0 avoids the types of flash that are most likely to cause seizure when viewed
         even for a second or two.
