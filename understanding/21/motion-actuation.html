		<h1>Understanding Motion Actuation</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that functions that are triggered by moving a device (for example, shaking or tilting) or by gesturing towards the device so that sensors or the camera can pick up and interpret these gestures, can also be operated via user interface components, unless the motion is essential for the function and not using it would invalidate the activity.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This criterion concerns input through sensors which respond directly to motions such as tilting, shaking, or gesturing towards a device. It is not intended to cover the motion of users through space as registered by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events observed by the device other than intentional gestures by the user. It also does not cover indirect motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology.</p>
<p>Devices often have sensors that can act as inputs, e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on a phone or tablet device. These sensors can allow the user to control something by simply changing the orientation or moving the device in particular ways. In other situations, web content can interpret user gestures via the camera or other sensors to actuate functions, for example, to move forward or backward in a sequence of pages. Some users with disabilities are not able to operate these device sensors (either not at all or not precisely enough) because the device is affixed to a wheelchair or due to motor impairments. Functionality must therefore be implemented in a way that other means are available to activate the function that do not rely on sensor input.</p>
<p>Some applications are specifically created to use device sensor data. Examples of content that are exempt from this requirement include a pedometer that relies on device motion to count steps.</p>

        <p>@@We should clarify that authors may be able to meet this when OS settings for control of a particular type of motion allow the user to disable the motion detection.</p>
      
      <p>If technologies of the chosen accessibility baseline (e.g. a mobile operating system) provide the option to disable the motion detection for a particular type of motion, this success criterion may be met by preventing that type of input.</p>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				
				<ul>
					<li>This Success Criterion helps people who may be unable to perform particular actions (such as tilting, shaking, or gesturing) because the device may be mounted or users may be physically unable to perform the necessary action. This success criterion ensures that users can still operate all functionality by other means (e.g., touch or voice input).</li>
  <li>All users may benefit, for example, users who are temporarily unable to hold and move the device because their hands are occupied with some other activity.</li>
				</ul>

		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>After text input in a field, shaking a device shows a dialog offering users to undo the input. A cancel button next to the text field offers the same functionality - activating it reverts to the content (if any) that was shown before the user input replaced it.</li>
  <li>A user can tilt a device to advance to the next or a previous page. Buttons or links are also provided to perform the same function.</li>
  <li>A user can move or pan a device to change the view in an interactive photo. A control is also available to perform the same function.</li>
 <li>A user can gesture towards the device to navigate content. Controls are also available to navigate.</li>

				<h3>Sufficient</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not use the devicemotion event to activate content functionality</li>
          <li>GXXX: Provide alternative means of input for a device's motion sensor inputs</li>

				<h2>Failure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Content functionality solely relies on input via devicemotion events (e.g. shaking or tilting)</li>
