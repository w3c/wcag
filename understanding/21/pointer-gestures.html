    <h1><strong>Pointer Gestures</strong><br />Understanding SC 2.5.1</h1>
    <p class="sctext"><strong>2.5.1 Pointer Gestures:</strong> All functionality which uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single-point activation, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
      <div class="note-title marker" aria-level="5" role="heading">Note</div>
      <p>This requirement applies to web content which interprets pointer gestures (i.e. this does not apply to gestures that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology). </p>
    </div>
    
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that, wherever possible, content can be operated through single point activation. Some users cannot perform path-based or multi-point gestures in a precise manner - they may lack the accuracy or speed necessary to carry it out. Path-based gestures include swiping, dragging, or the drawing of a complex path on the screen. Multi-point gestures include a two-finger pinch zoom, a split tap where one finger rests on the screen and a second finger taps, or a three finger tap or swipe.</p>
<p>Authors must therefore ensure that their content can be operated without complex gestures. When they implement complex path-based or multi-point gestures, they should ensure that the functionality can also be operated via single-point activation. Single-point activation includes, but is not limited to, tapping, double tapping or long presses on a touchscreen or drawing tablet, single clicks, click-and-hold and double clicks via mouse pointer input, or an equivalent single-point activation via trackpad or laser pointer input.</p>
      <p>The success criterion applies to author-created gestures, as opposed to gestures defined on the level of operating systems or user agents. An example for gestures provided on the operating system level would be gestures for built-in assistive technologies (AT) to focus or activate content, or to call up AT menus. An example of user agent-implemented gestures would be horizontal swiping implemented by browsers for navigating within the page history, or vertical dragging to scroll content.</p>

<p>While an OS may provide ways to define "macros" to replace complex gestures, this option is not pervasive on all touch-enabled platforms. Moreover, this may work for standard gestures that a user can predefine, but may not work for other author-defined gestures.</p>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Users who cannot (accurately) perform complex pointer gestures will be able to operate the content.</p></li>
          <li><p>The availability of user interface elements provided as a fallback for complex gestures helps users who may be unaware of the support for complex pointer gestures. This can be beneficial especially for users with cognitive or learning disabilities.</p></li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
				<ul>
        <li><p>A web application that includes a map view supports the pinch gesture to zoom into the map content, and drag gestures to move the visible area. User interface controls offer the operation via [+] and [-] buttons to zoom in and out, and arrow buttons to pan stepwise in all directions.</p></li>
        <li><p>A news site has a carousel slider with different news teasers that can be browsed via horizontal swipes. It also has arrow buttons to browse carousel items forward or backward.</p></li>

			<h2>Techniques for  SC 2.5.1 - Pointer Gestures</h2>    
				<h3>Sufficient Techniques</h3>			
       <ul>
         <li><p>GXXX: Do not rely solely on complex pointer gestures that require high precision or specific timings</p></li>
         <li><p>GXXX: Do not rely on multi-pointer gestures</p></li>
         <li><p>GXXX: Provide controls that do not require complex gestures and perform the same function as a complex gesture</p></li>
