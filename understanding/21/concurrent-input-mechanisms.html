		<h1>Understanding Concurrent Input Mechanisms</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p class="instructions">This section contains the main explanatory content of the Understanding. It explains why the Guideline or Success Criterion exists and, at a high level, how to meet it.</p>
			<section id="benefits">
        <p>When interacting with web content, users may employ a variety of input mechanisms (such as keyboard and keyboard-like interfaces, or pointer devices such as a mouse, stylus or touchscreen).
        Users may switch between input mechanisms at any point during their interaction. Input mechanisms may dynamically be added or removed. Even if a device has a primary/preferred input mechanism (for instance,
        the touchscreen on mobile phones and tablets), the user may instead employ alternative input mechanisms (such as a paired mouse or external keyboard in the case of mobile phones and tablets).
        Content must therefore be "input agnostic": not make assumptions about which input mechanism is the primary/preferred one, and not limit the user's interaction to any particular input mechanism.</p>
        
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p class="instructions">This explains how following the success criterion benefits particular types of users with disabilities.</p>
        <p></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Users are able to interact with web content with whichever input mechanism is available to them.</li>
          <li>Users are able to add/remove input mechanisms.</li>
          <li>Users can switch between input mechanisms when they desire or the circumstances demand it.</li>
				</ul>

		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Examples in Understanding pages are normally simple lists of hand-waving examples. Sometimes, examples are instead provided in sub-sections with headings. In either case, examples should stay high-level and not get into code specifics, which is for techniques.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Even though content is being viewed on a mobile phone with a touchscreen, users are able to pair a mouse and keyboard with the phone and operate the content - the content does not assume that the touchscreen is the only input modality the user will want to employ.</li>
          <li>On a touch-enabled laptop, users are still able to interact with content using their trackpad and keyboard.</li>
          <li>A user starts interacting with a page using a keyboard on their computer, and they attach a secondary touch-enabled monitor. Content can be operated using this newly added input mechanism, and does not assume that the first input mechanism it detected is the only one in use.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<div class="instructions">
				<p>This section references techniques that can be used to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion. There are sub-sections for sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and failures. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Within each sub-section, there may be "situations" to describe when a set of techniques need to be considered. Remove the sub-section and heading if situations are not used.</li>
					<li>Techniques are provided in an unordered list. Reference techniques by linking to the filename of the technique and using the technique ID as link text. Use unlinked plain text if the technique has not been written yet.</li>
					<li>If more than one technique must be used for full sufficiency, list them in the same bullet separated by "AND".</li>
					<li>If a general technique requires technology-specific techniques to be implemented, end the bullet with "using" and provide a sub-list of those techniques.</li>
					<li>Square brackets indicate optional components.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remove any parts of the template that are not used, such as the section and heading for situations, sub-lists of techniques, or the "AND" construction. Also remove the square brackets around placeholder optional components.</p>
			</div>
			<section id="sufficient">
				<h3>Sufficient</h3>
				<p class="instructions">Techniques that are sufficient to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion.</p>
				<ul>
          <li>Only using high-level, input-agnostic event handlers (<code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code>, <code>click</code>) in Javascript (operating systems/UAs fire these events for all input mechanisms).</li>
          <li>Registering event handlers for keyboard/keyboard-like and pointer inputs simultaneously in Javascript (see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#examples">Example 1 in Pointer Events Level 2</a>)</li>
        </ul>
			</section>
			<section id="failure">
				<h2>Failure</h2>
				<p class="instructions">Techniques that document conditions that would cause the page not to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion, even if sufficient techniques are also used.</p>
				<p class="instructions">Same template as sufficient techniques.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Registering <em>either</em> touch event handlers <em>or</em> keyboard/mouse event handlers based on a feature check/presence of a touchscreen in Javascript.</li>
          <li>Using CSS Media Queries Level 4 Interaction Media Features to determine what the UA deems to be the "primary" input mechanism and assuming no other input mechanisms are present/may be added/may be used.</li>
        </ul>
