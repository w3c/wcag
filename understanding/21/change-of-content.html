		<h1>Status Changes<br>
		Understanding SC 3.2.6</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent of this Success Criterion</h2>
			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure more users can be made aware of important changes in content that are not given focus, in a way that doesn't unnecessarily interrupt their work.</p>
			<p>The intended beneficiaries are blind and low vision users of assistive technologies with screen reader capabilities. As well, assistive technologies for users with cognitive disabilities may achieve an alternative means of indicating (or even delaying or supressing) status messages, as preferred by the user.</p>
<p>The scope of this Success Criterion is specific to changes in content that involve status messages. Information can frequently be added to pages which does not meet the definition of a status message. For example, the list of results obtained from a search are not considered a status update and thus are not covered by this Success Criterion. However, brief text messages displayed about the completion or status of the search, such as "18 results returned" or "no results returned" would be status updates. Examples of status messages are given in the section titled <a href="#status-examples">Status Message Examples</a> below.

<p>This Success Criterion specifically addresses scenarios where new content is added to the screen without changing the user's context. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WCAG20-20060427/appendixA.html#context-changedef">Changes of context</a>, by their nature, interrupt the user; they are already surfaced by assistive technologies, and so have already met the objectives of this Success Criterion. Examples of scenarios that add new content by changing the context are given in the section titled <a href="#excepted-examples">Examples of Excepted Context Changes</a> below.</p>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<ul>
					<li>When appropriate roles or properties are assigned to status messages, the new content is spoken by screen readers in such a way as to assist blind and low vision users. Most sighted users can observe text peripherally added to the viewport. Such content provides additional information without affecting the user's current point of regard. The ability of an assistive technology to announce such new important text content allows more users to benefit from awareness of the information in an equivalent manner.</li>
			<li>Assigning proper roles or properties to status messages provides possible future uses, such as the potential to be exploited by assistive technologies created for users with some cognitive disabilities. Where page authors elect to design additions to the screen which do not change the user's context (i.e., take focus), the information is arguably of less importance than something presented using a modal dialog, which must be acknowledged by the user. As such, depending on the user's preferences, an assistive technology may choose to delay, suppress, or transform such messages so a user is not unnecessarily interrupted; or conversely the assistive technology may highlight such messages where the user finds it optimal to do so.</li>

				<li>After a user presses a Search button, the contents are updated to include the results of the search, which are displayed in a section below the Search button. The content changes also include the message "5 results returned" near the top of this new content. This text is given an appropriate role for a status message. . A screen reader announces, "Five results returned".</li>
				<li>After a user presses an Add to Shopping Cart button, a section of content near the Shopping Cart icon adds the text "5 items". A screen reader announces "5 items" or "Shopping cart, 5 items".</li>
				<li>After a user enters incorrect text in an input called Postal Code, a message appears above the input reading "Invalid entry".  The screen reader announces, "Invalid entry" or "Postal code, invalid entry".</li>
				<li>After a user activates a process, an icon symbolizing 'busy'  appears on the screen, then disappears after 25 seconds. The screen reader announces "Application busy", then after 25 seconds announces "Application available".</li>
				<li>An application displays a progressbar to indicate the status of an upgrade. The element is implemented using best authoring practices, and is assigned a suitable role and importance. The screen reader provides intermittent announcements of the progress. </li>
        <li>After a user submits a form, the screen reader announces "Your form was successfully submitted."</li> 
        <li>After a user unsuccessfully fills in a form because some of the data is in the incorrect format, the screen reader announces "5 errors on page"</li>

				<h3>Examples of Changes that Do Not Add New Text to the Screen</h3>
			</section>
			<p>Not all changes to content involve the addition of text to the screen. The following are all considerations relevant to this Success Criterion:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Non-displayed text specific to AT users</li>

<li>Modification of status text</li>
<li>Removal of status text</li>
<li>textual status content, such as images</li>

		</section>
		<h4>Non-displayed text specific to AT users</h4>
		<p>This Success Criterion was intentionally worded to apply primarily to visible changes of content. The reason for this is that where new text is displayed, it is intended to be visible to all users. By providing a programmatic means of ensuring the text is also surfaced through assistive technologies, the Success Criterion provides the same information to users who cannot or may not see it. However, the manner in which the information is displayed (for example its proximity to other pieces of information) may mean that the text change alone does not convey sufficient information to the user of the assistive technology.</p>
		<p>In such cases, authors may wish to designate additional content for inclusion in the status message, including non-displayed text which can be provided to the assistive technologies, for added context. Important considerations regarding the appropriate use of such techniques are further discussed in the Sufficient Techniques.</p>
		<h4>Modification of status text</h4>
		<p>If a status message persists on the page, modifications to this text are usually equivalent to a new status message. An example would be a shopping cart which updates text from reading "0 items" to "3 items". Typical methods of writing such changes in the page content result in the entire modified text string being considered a new change, and thus read by assistive technologies. However, where only the number in this string was coded as an updated chunk of content, the resulting experience for screen reader users would be to only hear "three", which may not be sufficient information to provide context for the user. In such situations, marking the entire "3 items" string as the status text would normally be a better solution.</p>
		<h4>Removal of status text</h4>
		<p>In situations where status text is entirely removed, its absence may itself convey information about the status. The most obvious example of this is where a message is displayed that the system is "busy" or "waiting". For a sighted user, when this text disappears, it is normally an indication that the state is now available. However non-sighted users would be unaware of this change, unless the end of the waiting state results in a change of context for the user. The use of a non-visible status message, such as "system available", ensures equivalent status information is provided.</p>
		<h4>Non-textual status content</h4>
		<p>Changes in content are not restricted to text changes. Where an icon or sound indicates a status message, existing WCAG requirements governing text alternatives, under SC 1.1.1 Non-Text Content, in combination with  this Success Criterion's requirement of an appropriate role, will allow the text alternative to be announced by the screen reader.</p>
<section class="example">
				<h3 id="excepted-examples">Examples of Excepted Changes</h3>
			</section>
			<p>The following examples identify situations where no additional author action is necessary. All cases are excepted from this Success Criterion since they do not meet the definition of "status messages".</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p>An author displays an error message in a dialog.</p>
				<p>Since the dialog takes focus, it is defined as a change of context and does not meet the definition of a status message. As a result of taking focus, the new change of context is announced by the screen reader, and is not included in the scope of this Success Criterion. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Content is exposed or hidden when a user interacts with a user interface component, for example expanding components such as a menu, select, accordion or tree, or selecting a different tab item in a tablist.</p>
				<p>None of the resulting changes to content meet the definition of status messages. Further, all components that meet the definition of a user interface component already have requirements specified under <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#user-interface-componentdef">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>, including the need to make notifications of changes to states available to user agents, including assistive technologies. As a result, changes in state, such as "expanded" or "collapsed," would be announced by the screen reader, and thus do not need to be addressed by this Success Criterion.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>After a user completes an input that indicates they are unhappy, a series of new inputs are added to the page about customer satisfaction.</p>
				<p>Since the new inputs do not "provide information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting state of an application, on the progress of a process or on the existence of errors" they do not meet the definition of status message, and so are not required to meet this Success Criterion. [Note: Creating a status message about these controls being added, or notifying the user in advance that content changes may take place based on the user's response, are best practices, but are not requirements in this scenario.]</p>

			<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
			<p class="instructions"></p>
<p>In addition to the use of non-displayed text for AT users, there are a number of considerations for content changes which are relevant to this Success Criterion, but which fall outside its scope. To prevent the possible perpetuation of poor design, the following best practices are discussed.</p>
