		<h1>Understanding SC 2.5.3 Target Size</h1>
	<section id="intent">
		<h2>Intent</h2>
		<p>The intent of this success criterion is to help users who may have trouble activating a small target because of hand tremors, limited dexterity or other reasons. If the target is too small, it may be difficult to aim at the target. Mice and similar pointing devices can be hard to use for these users, and a larger target will help them greatly in having positive outcomes on the web page.</p>
			<p>Touch is particularly problematic as it is an input mechanism with coarse precision. Users lack the same level of fine control as on inputs such as a mouse or stylus. A finger is larger than a mouse pointer, and generally obstructs the user's view of the precise location on the screen that is being touched/activated.</p>
			<p>The issue can be further complicated on for responsive/mobile which need to accommodate different types of fine and coarse inputs (e.g. a site that can be accessed both on a traditional desktop/laptop with a mouse, as well as on a tablet or mobile phone with a touch screen).</p>
			<p>While this criterion defines a minimum target size, it is recommended that larger sizes are used to reduce the possibility of unintentional actions. This is particularly relevant if any of the following are true:</p>
	  <ul>
			  <li>the control is used frequently;</li>
			  <li>the result of the interaction cannot be easily undone;</li>
			  <li>the control is positioned where it will be difficult to reach, or is near the edge of the screen;</li>
			  <li>the control is part of a sequential task.</li>
	  </ul>
		<section id="benefits">
			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Users who use a mobile device where touch screen is the primary mode of interaction</li>
			  <li>Users with mobility impairments, such as hand tremors</li>
			  <li>Users who find fine motor movements difficult</li>
			  <li>Users who access a device using one hand</li>
			  <li>Users with large fingers, or who are operating the device with only a part of their finger or knuckle</li>
			  <li>Users who have low vision may better see the target</li>
		  </ul>

	<section id="examples">
	  <h2>Examples</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Example 1: Buttons</strong><br>
		      Three buttons are on-screen and the touch target area of each button is 44 by 44 CSS pixels.</li>
			  <li><strong>Example 2: Customizable</strong><br>
			    A mechnanism is provided to allow users to increase the target size of the targets on the page to meet the minimum target dimensions.<br>
			  </li>
			  <li><strong>Example 3:</strong> <strong>Redundant target<br>
		      </strong>Multiple targets are provided on the page that perform the same function. One of the targets is 44 by 44 CSS pixels. The other targets do not have a minimum touch target of 44 by 44 CSS pixels.</li>
			  <li><strong>Example 4: Anchor Link</strong><br>
			    The target is an in-page link anchor and the target is less than 44px by 44px.  Users can scroll the screen
			    using browser functions so target size does not need to be met.<br>
		      </li>
			  <li><strong>Example 5: In-Page Text Link</strong><br>
			    Links 
			  within a paragraph of text have varying touch target dimensions. Links within paragraphs of text do no need to meet the 44 by 44 CSS pixels requirements.</li>
			  <li><strong>Example 6: Groups of Targets</strong><br>
			    A navigation list contains more than 5 items and each target is 44 by 22 CSS pixels.</li>
      </ul>
