		<h1>Understanding Non-text Contrast</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>


			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that active user interface components (i.e., controls) and meaningful graphics are distinguishable by people with moderately low vision. The requirements and rationale are similar to those for large text in <a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>.</p>

			<p>Low contrast controls are more difficult to perceive, and may be completely missed by people with a visual impairment. Similarly, if a graphic is needed to understand the content or functionality of the webpage then it should be perceivable by people with low vision or other impairments without the need for contrast-enhancing assistive technology.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>The 3:1 contrast ratios referenced in this Success Criterion is intended to be treated as threshold values. When comparing the computed contrast ratio to the Success Criterion ratio, the computed values should not be rounded (e.g. 2.999:1 would not meet the 3:1 threshold).</p>
			</div>

			<section id="user-interface-components">
				<h3>Active User Interface Components</h3>

				<p>For active controls any visual information provided that is necessary for a user to identify that a control is present and how to operate it must have a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with the adjacent colors. Also, any visual information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.</p>
        
				<p>This Success Criterion does not require that changes in color that differentiate between states of an individual component meet the 3:1 contrast ratio when they do not appear next to each other. For example, there is not a new requirement that visited links contrast with the default color, or that mouse hover indicators contrast with the default state. However, the component must not lose contrast with the adjacent colors, and non-text indicators such as the check in a checkbox, or an arrow graphic indicating a menu is selected or open must have sufficient contrast to the adjacent colors.</p>

				<h4>Boundaries</h4>
				
				<p>This success criterion does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast. If text (or an icon) within a button or placeholder text inside a text input is visible and there is no visual indication of the hit area then the Success Criterion is passed. If a button with text also has a colored border, since the border does not provide the only indication there is no contrast requirement beyond the text contrast (<a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>). Note that for people with cognitive disabilities it is recommended to delineate the boundary of controls to aid in the recognition of controls and therefore the completion of activities.</p>

						<img alt="Two buttons, the first with no visual indicator except text saying 'button'. The second is the same but with an added grey border." src="img/minimal-button.png" /> 
						<figcaption>A button (active control) without a visual boundary, and the same button with a focus indicator that is a defined visual boundary of grey (#949494) adjacent to white.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h4>Adjacent colors</h4>
				<p>For user interface components 'adjacent colors' means the colors adjacent to the component. For example, if an input has a white internal background, dark border, and white external background the 'adjacent color' to the component would be the white external background.</p>
				<figure id="figure-standard-text-adjacent-white">
					<img src="img/text-input-default.png" alt="Standard text input with a label, white internal and external background with a dark border." />
					<figcaption>A standard text input with a grey border (#767676) and white adjacent color outside the component</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>If components use several colors, any color which does not interfere with identifying the component can be ignored for the purpose of measuring contrast ratio. For example, a 3D drop-shadow on an input, or a dark border line between contrasting backgrounds is considered to be subsumed into the color closest in brightness (perceived luminance).</p>

				<p>The following example shows an input that has a light background on the inside and a dark background around it. The input also has a dark grey border which is considered to be subsumed into the dark background. The border does not interfere with identifying the component, so the contrast ratio is taken between the white background and dark blue background.</p>

				<figure id="figure-text-box-dark-bg-light-border">
					<img alt="A text box with a dark background and light border, with a white background." src="img/text-input-background-border.png" />
					<figcaption> The contrast of the input background (white) and color adjacent to the control (dark blue #003366) is sufficient. There is also a border (silver) on the component that is not required to contrast with either.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>For visual information required to identify a state, such as the check in a checkbox or the thumb of a slider, that part might be within the component so the adjacent color might be another part of the component.</p>

				<figure id="figure-purple-box-light-check">
					<img alt="A purple box with a light grey check." src="img/checkbox-purple.png" />
					<figcaption> A customized checkbox with light grey check (#E5E5E5), which has a contrast ratio of 5.6:1 with the purple box (#6221EA).</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>It is possible to use a flat design where the status indicator fills the component and does not contrast with the component, but does contrast with the colors adjacent to the component.</p>


				<figure id="figure-three-radios">
					<img alt="Four radio buttons, the first is a plain circle labelled 'Not selected'. The second shows the circle filled with a darker color than the border. The third is filled with the same color as the border. The fourth has an inner filled circle with a gap between it and the outer border." src="img/radio-custom.png" />
					<figcaption>The first radio button shows the default state with a grey (#949494) circle. The second and third show the radio button selected and filled with a color that contrasts with the color adjacent to the component. The last example shows the state indicator contrasting with the component colors.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h4 id="related-color">Relationship with Use of Color</h4>

				<p>The <a href="use-of-color">Use of Color</a> success criterion addresses changing <strong>only the color</strong> (hue) of an object or text without otherwise altering the object's form. The principle is that contrast ratio (the difference in brightness) can be used to distinguish text or graphics. For example, <a href="../../techniques/general/G183.html">G183</a> is a technique to use a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text to distinguish links and controls. In that case the Working Group regards a link color that meets the 3:1 contrast ratio relative to the non-linked text color as satisfying the Success Criterion <a href="use-of-color">1.4.1 Use of color</a> since it is relying on contrast ratio as well as color (hue) to convey that the text is a link.</p>

				<p>Non-text information within controls that uses a change of hue alone to convey the value or state of an input, such as a 1-5 star indicator with a black outline for each star filled with either yellow (full) or white (empty) is likely to fail the Use of color criterion rather than this one.</p>

				<figure id="figure-two-star-ratings">
					<img src="img/star-examples-pass.png" alt="Two star ratings, one uses a black outline (on white) with a black fill to indicate it is checked. The second has a yellow fill and a thicker dark border." width="300" />
					<figcaption>
						Two examples which pass this success criterion, using either a solid fill to indicate a checked-state that has contrast, or a thicker border as well as yellow fill.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure id="figure-two-star-ratings-failing">
					<img src="img/star-examples-fail.png" alt="Two star ratings, the first uses 5 stars with a black outline and a yellow or white fill, where yellow indicates checked. The second uses only pale yellow stars on white." width="300" />
					<figcaption>
						Two examples which fail a success criterion, the first fails the Use of color criterion due to relying on yellow and white hues. The second example fails the Non-text contrast criterion due to the yellow (#FFF000) to white contrast ratio of 1.2:1.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Using a change of contrast for focus and other states is a technique to differentiate the states. This is the basis for <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G195" class="general">G195: Using an author-supplied, highly visible focus indicator</a>, and more techniques are being added.</p>


				<h4 id="related-focus">Relationship with Focus Visible</h4>
				
				<p>In combination with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#focus-visible">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a>, the visual focus indicator for a component <em>must</em> have sufficient contrast against the adjacent background when the component is focused, except where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.</p>

				<p>Most focus indicators appear outside the component - in that case it needs to contrast with the background that the component is on. Other cases include focus indicators which are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>only inside the component and need to contrast with the adjacent color(s) within the component.</li>
					<li>the border of the component (inside the component and adjacent to the outside) and need to contrast with both adjacent colours. </li>
					<li>partly inside and partly outside, where either part of the focus indicator can contrast with the adjacent colors.</li>
				</ul>

				<figure id="figure-focus-inner">
					<img src="img/ntc-focus-inner.png" alt="Three blue buttons, the middle has a thick yellow outline well inside the border of the button." width="400" />
					<figcaption>
						The internal yellow indicator (#FFFF00) contrasts with the blue button background (#4189B9), <strong>passing</strong> the criterion.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>


				<figure id="figure-focus-outer-yellow">
					<img src="img/ntc-focus-outer-yellow.png" alt="Three blue buttons on a white background, the middle has a light yellow outline outside of the botton's non-focused boundary." width="400" />
					<figcaption>
						The external yellow indicator (#FFFF00) does not contrast with the white background (#FFF) which the component is on, <strong>failing</strong> the criterion.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure id="figure-focus-outer-green">
					<img src="img/ntc-focus-outer-green.png" alt="Three blue buttons on a white background, the middle has a dark green outline outside of the botton's non-focused boundary." width="400" />
					<figcaption>
						The external green indicator (#008000) does contrast with the white background (#FFF) which the component is on, <strong>passing</strong> the criterion. It does not need to contrast with both the component background and the component.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Although the figure above with a dark outline passes non-text contrast, it is not a good indicator unless it is very thick. <span class="wcag22">There is a criterion in WCAG 2.2 that addresses this aspect, <a href="../22/focus-appearance-minimum.html">Focus Appearance</a>.</span></p>

				<p>If an indicator is partly inside and partly outside the component, either part of the indicator could provide contrast.</p>

				<figure id="figure-focus-outer-inner">
					<img src="img/ntc-focus-inner-outer.png" alt="Three blue buttons on a white background, the middle has the outline of a yellow rectangle that is partly inside the button's boundary, and partly outside on the white background." width="400" />
					<figcaption>
						The focus indicator is partially inside, partially outside the button. The internal part of the yellow indicator (#FFFF00) contrasts with the blue button background (#4189B9), <strong>passing</strong> the criterion.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>If the focus indicator changes the border of the component within the visible boundary it must contrast with the component. Typically an outline goes around (outside) the visible boundary of the component, in this case changing the border is just inside the visible edge of the component.</p>

				<figure id="figure-focus-border">
					<img src="img/ntc-focus-border.png" alt="Three blue buttons on a white background, the center button has a green border exactly on the outer boundary of the button." width="400" />
					<figcaption>
						The border of the control changes from blue (#4189B9) to green (#4B933A). This is within the component and does not contrast with the inside background of the component therefore <strong>fails</strong> non-text contrast.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure id="figure-focus-inner-green">
					<img src="img/ntc-focus-inner-border.png" alt="Three blue buttons with a black border on a white background, the center button has a green border inside, adjacent to the inner background and black border." width="400" />
					<figcaption>
						An inner border of dark green (#008000) does contrast with the black border, but does not contrast with the blue component background, therefore <strong>fails</strong> non-text contrast.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure id="figure-focus-inner-white">
					<img src="img/ntc-focus-inner-white.png" alt="Three blue buttons with a black border on a white background, the center button has a white border inside, adjacent to the inner background and black border." width="400" />
					<figcaption>
						An inner border of white contrasts with the black border and the blue component background, therefore <strong>passes</strong> non-text contrast.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

		        <p>Note that this Success Criterion does not directly compare the focused and unfocused states of a control - if the focus state relies on a change of color (e.g., changing <em>only</em> the background color of a button), this Success Criterion does not define any requirement for the difference in contrast between the two states.</p>

				<figure id="figure-focus-background">
					<img src="img/ntc-focus-background.png" alt="Three blue buttons, the center button is a lighter blue than the others." width="400" />
					<figcaption>
						The change of background within the component is not in scope of non-text contrast. However, this would not pass <a href="use-of-color.html">Use of color</a>.
					</figcaption>

					<h4>Inactive User Interface Components</h4>

					<p>User Interface Components that are not available for user interaction (e.g., a disabled control in HTML) are not required to meet contrast requirements in WCAG 2.1. An inactive user interface component is visible but not currently operable. An example would be a submit button at the bottom of a form that is visible but cannot be activated until all the required fields in the form are completed.</p>
					<figure id="figure-grey-button-and-text">
						<img src="img/inactive-button.png" alt="Grey button with non-contrasting grey text." width="120" />
						<figcaption> An inactive button using default browser styles</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Inactive components, such as disabled controls in HTML, are not available for user interaction. The decision to exempt inactive controls from the contrast requirements was based on a number of considerations. Although it would be benefitial to some people to discern inactive controls, a one-size-fits-all solution has been very difficult to establish. A method of varying the presentation of disabled controls, such as adding an icon for disabled controls, based on user preferences is anticipated as an advancement in the future.</p>

				<h3>Graphical Objects</h3>


				<p>The term &quot;graphical object&quot; applies to stand-alone icons such as a print icon (with no text), and the important parts of a more complex diagram such as each line in a graph. For simple graphics such as single-color icons the entire image is a graphical object. Images made up of multiple lines, colors and shapes will be made of multiple graphical objects, some of which are required for understanding.</p>

				<p>Not every graphical object needs to contrast with its surroundings - only those that are required for a user to understand what the graphic is conveying. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Pr.C3.A4gnanz">Gestalt principles</a> such as the &quot;law of continuity&quot; can be used to ignore minor overlaps with other graphical objects or colors.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Assess what part of each image is needed to understand what it represents.<br />
						The magnet's "U" shape can be conveyed by the outline or by the red background (either is acceptable). The white tips are also important (otherwise it would be a horseshoe), which needs to contrast with the red background.</li>
					<li>Assume that the user could only see those aspects. Do they contrast with the adjacent colors?<br />
						The outline of the magnet contrasts with the surrounding text (black/white), and the red and white between the tips also has sufficient contrast.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Due to the strong contrast of the red and white, it would also be possible to only put the outline around the white tips of the magnet and it would still conform.</p>

				<section>
				<h4>Required for Understanding</h4>

				<p>The term &quot;required for understanding&quot; is used in the Success Criterion as many graphics do not need to meet the contrast requirements. If a person needs to perceive a graphic, or part of a graphic (a graphical object) in order to understand the content it should have sufficient contrast. However, that is not a requirement when:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>A graphic with text embedded or overlayed conveys the same information, such as labels <em>and</em> values on a chart.</p>
						<p class="note">Text within a graphic must meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li> The graphic is for aesthetic purposes that does not require the user to see or understand it to understand the content or use the functionality.</li>
					<li> The information is available in another form, such as in a table that follows the graph, which becomes visible when a "Long Description" button is pressed.</li>
					<li> The graphic is part of a logo or brand name (which is considered &quot;essential&quot; to its presentation).</li>
				</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h4>Gradients</h4>

				<p>Gradients can reduce the apparent contrast between areas, and make it more difficult to test. The general principles is to identify the graphical object(s) required for understanding, and take the central color of that area. If you remove the adjacent color which does not have sufficient contrast, can you still identify and understand the graphical object?</p>
				<figure id="figure-blue-circle-i-versions">
          <img src="img/contrast-gradient.png" alt="Two versions of a blue circle with an 'i' indicating information. The first example has a blue gradient background, the second is missing the upper half of the background which obscures the i." width="300" />
				<figcaption>Removing the background which does not have sufficient contrast highlights that the graphical object (the &quot;i&quot;) is not then understandable.</figcaption></figure>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h4>Dynamic Examples</h4>

				<p>Some graphics may have interactions that either vary the contrast, or display the information as text when you mouseover/tap/focus each graphical object. In order for someone to discern the graphics exist at all, the unfocused default version must already have sufficiently contrasting colors or text. For the area that receives focus, information can then be made available dynamically as pop-up text, or be foregrounded dynamically by increasing the contrast.</p>

					<figcaption>A dynamic chart where the current 'slice' is hovered or focused, which activates the associated text display of the values and highlights the series</figcaption>

				<section>
				<h4>Infographics</h4>

				<p>Infographics can mean any graphic conveying data, such as a chart or diagram. On the web it is often used to indicate a large graphic with lots of statements, pictures, charts or other ways of conveying data. In the context of graphics contrast, each item within such an infographic should be treated as a set of graphical objects, regardless of whether it is in one file or separate files.</p>

				<p>Infographics often fail to meet several WCAG level AA criteria including:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html">1.4.1 Use of Color</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html">1.4.3 (Text) Contrast</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/images-of-text.html">1.4.5 Images of Text</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>An infographic can use text which meets the other criteria to minimise the number of graphical objects required for understanding. For example, using text with sufficient contrast to provide the values in a chart. A long description would also be sufficient because then the infograph is not relied upon for understanding.</p>

					<h4>Essential Exception</h4>

					<p>Graphical objects do not have to meet the contrast requirements when &quot;a particular presentation of graphics is essential to the information being conveyed&quot;. The Essential exception is intended to apply when there is no way of presenting the graphic with sufficient contrast without undermining the meaning. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Logotypes and flags</strong>: The brand logo of an organization or product is the representation of that organization and therefore exempt. Flags may not be identifiable if the colors are changed to have sufficient contrast.</li>
						<li><strong>Sensory</strong>: There is no requirement to change pictures of real life scenes such as photos of people or scenery.</li>
						<li><strong>Representing other things</strong>: If you cannot represent the graphic in any other way, it is essential. Examples include: 
							<ul>
								<li>Screenshots to demonstrate how a website appeared.</li>
								<li>Diagrams of medical information that use the colors found in biology (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye_it.svg">example medical schematic from Wikipedia</a>).</li>
								<li>color gradients that represent a measurement, such as heat maps (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eyetracking_heat_map_Wikipedia.jpg">example heatmap from Wikipedia</a>).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Testing Principles</h3>
					<p>A summary of the high-level process for finding and assessing non-text content on a web page:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Identify each user-interface component (link, button, form control) on the page and:
							<ul>
								<li>Identify the visual (non-text) indicators of the component that are required to identify that a control exists, and indicate the current state. In the default (on page load) state, test the contrast ratio against the adjacent colors.</li>
								<li>Test those contrast indicators in each state.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Identify each graphic on the page that includes information required for understanding the content (i.e. excluding graphics which have visible text for the same information, or are decorative) and:
							<ul>
								<li>Check the contrast of the graphical object against its adjacent colors;</li>
								<li>If there are multiple colors and/or a gradient, choose the least contrasting area to test;</li>
								<li>If it passes, move to the next graphical object;</li>
								<li>If the least-contrasting area is less than 3:1, assume that area is invisible, is the graphical object still understandable?</li>
								<li>If there is enough of the graphical object to understand, it passes, else fail.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The techniques below each have testing criteria, and the related criteria for <a href="focus-visible">Focus visible (2.4.7)</a>, <a href="use-of-color">Use of color (1.4.1)</a>, and <a href="contrast-minimum">Contrast minimum</a> also have techniques.</p>

		<section id="benefits">
			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<p>People with low vision often have difficulty perceiving graphics that have insufficient contrast. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#relativeluminancedef">relative luminance</a> (lightness difference) of 3:1 or greater can make these items more distinguishable when the person does not see a full range of colors.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Graphical Object Examples</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Status icons on an application's dashboard (without associated text) have a 3:1 minimum contrast ratio.</li>
				<li>A text input has a dark border around the white editable area.</li>
				<li>A graph uses a light background and ensures that the colors for each line have a 3:1 contrast ratio against the background.</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>Pie Charts</h3>
				<p>Pie charts make a good case study for the graphical objects part of this success criterion, the following pie charts are intended to convey the proportion of market share each browser has. Please Note: The actual figures are made up, these are not actual market shares. </p>
				<figure id="figure-failing-pie-chart">
					<img src="img/graphics-contrast_pie-chart_fail.png" alt="Failing pie chart" />
					<figcaption>
						<p><strong>Fail:</strong> The pie chart has labels for each slice (so passes 1.4.1 Use of Color), but in order to understand the proportions of the slices you must discern the edges of the slices (the graphical objects conveying essential information), and the contrast between the slices is not  3:1 or greater. </p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure id="figure-not-applicable-pie-chart">
					<img src="img/graphics-contrast_pie-chart_na.png" alt="Not applicable pie chart" />
					<figcaption>
						<p><strong>Not applicable:</strong> The pie chart has visible labels <em>and</em> values that convey equivalent information to the graphical objects (the pie slices). </p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure id="figure-passing-pie-chart">
					<img src="img/graphics-contrast_pie-chart_pass.png" alt="Passing pie chart" />
					<figcaption>
						<p><strong>Pass:</strong> The pie chart has visible labels, and sufficient contrast around and between the slices of the pie chart (the graphical objects). A darker border has been added around the yellow slice in order to achieve the contrast level.</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

			<section class="example">
				<h3>Infographics</h3>
				<figure id="figure-infographic-light-circles">
					<img src="img/infographic-fail.png" alt="An infographic showing lightly colored circles of various sizes to indicate the size of five different social networks" />
					<figcaption>
						<p><strong>Fail:</strong> Discerning the circles is required to understand the size of network and discerning the icons in each circle is required to identify which network it shows.</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The graphical objects are the circles (measured against the background) and the icons in each circle (measured against the circle's background).</p>
				<figure id="figure-infographic-contrasting-text">
					<img src="img/infographic-pass.png" alt="The same infographic with contrasting text, dark borders around the circles, and contrasting icons." />
					<figcaption>
						<p><strong>Pass:</strong> The circles have contrasting borders and the icons are a contrasting dark color against the light circle backgrounds.</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>There are many possible solutions to ensuring contrast, the example shows the use of borders. Other techniques are to use darker colors for the circle backgrounds, or to add text labels &amp; values for each item.</p>
