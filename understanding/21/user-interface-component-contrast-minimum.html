		<h1>Understanding User Interface Component Contrast</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>The intent of this success criterion is to apply the contrast requirements to essential visual identifiers related to user interface components in a similar way that it is applied to text in 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum).</p>
      <h3>Essential</h3>
      <p>If essential non-text information is needed to understand the state and/or functionality of the user interface component then it must be perceivable for people with low vision or color blindness.</p>
      <h3>Thin and Thick</h3>
      <p>Visual identifiers that are very thin are harder to perceive, therefore have a higher contrast requirement of 4.5:1. Visual identifiers that are thicker or are solid shapes have a lower requirement of 3:1</p>
      <p>The size 3 CSS pixel for 'thick' was selected as it aligns with the large-text requirement of 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum). See additional information about this concept at on <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/Informational_Graphic_Contrast_(Minimum)#Notes_on_how_the_contrast_and_thickness_were_derived|notes">how contrast and thickness were derived</a>.</p>
			<section id="benefits">
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast for interactive user interface components, form field borders, focus and selection indicators so they can be perceived by people with moderately low vision (who do not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology).</p>

<p>People with low vision often have difficulty perceiving graphics that have insufficient contrast. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a relative luminance (lightness) difference of 4.5:1 or greater can make these items more distinguishable when the person does not see a full range of colors and does not use assistive technology.</p>

<p>When non-text content is larger, a color contrast of 3:1 or greater can be sufficient for perception by people with moderately low vision.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>A thin (under 3 CSS pixel width) border on form fields in a university admissions application have a 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio.</li>
      <li>A thick (3 CSS pixel or wider) border on form fields in a university admission application has a 3:1 minimum contrast ratio.</li>
      <li>Focus indicators on all links in a Web site have a 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Sufficient Contrast Examples</h3>
<p>For designers developing focus indicators, selection indicators and user interface components that need to be perceived clearly, the following are examples that have sufficient contrast.<p>
