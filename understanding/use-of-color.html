            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all sighted users can access
               information
               that is conveyed by color differences, that is, by the use of color where each color
               has a meaning assigned to it. If the information is conveyed through color differences
               in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color
               deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through
               another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.
               
            </p>
            <p>Color is an important asset in design of Web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal,
               its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving
               color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older
               users do not see color well. In addition, people using limited-color or
               monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented
               only in color.
               
            </p>
            <p>Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields are red",
               “error is shown in red", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's are in blue". Examples
               of indications of an action include: using color to indicate that a link will open
               in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully. An example
               of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that
               a required field had been left blank.
               
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  
                  <p>This should not in any way discourage the use of color on a page, or even color coding
                     if it is complemented by other visual indication.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
               </div>
            </div>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  
                  <p>If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in their hue,
                     but that also have a significant difference in lightness, then this counts as an additional
                     visual distinction, as long as the difference in relative luminance between the colors
                     leads
                     to a contrast ratio of 3:1 or greater.
                     For example, a light green and a dark red differ <strong>both</strong> by color (hue)
                     <strong>and</strong> by lightness, so they would pass if the contrast ratio is at least 3:1.
                     Similarly, if content is distinguished by inverting an element's foreground and background
                     colors,
                     this would pass (again, assuming that the foreground and background colors have a
                     sufficient contrast).
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>However, if content relies on the user's ability to accurately perceive or differentiate
                     a particular color
                     an additional visual indicator will be required regardless of the contrast ratio between
                     those colors. For example, 
                     knowing whether an outline is green for valid or red for invalid.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
               </div>
            </div>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  
                  <p>This criterion does not directly address the needs of users with assistive technologies.
                     It aims to ensure that sighted users who cannot distinguish between some colors can
                     still
                     understand content.
                     How information is conveyed to assistive technology users is covered separately in
                     other
                     criteria, including (but not limited to)
                     <a href="non-text-content">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>,
                     <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>, and
                     <a href="name-role-value">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Conversely, even if information that is conveyed by color differences is appropriately
                     conveyed
                     to assistive technologies, it does not necessarily pass this criterion, as sighted
                     users who cannot
                     distinguish between certain color may not necessarily be using any assistive technologies.
                     This
                     criterion requires a visible alternative to color.
