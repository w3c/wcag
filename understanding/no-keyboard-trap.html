         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#no-keyboard-trap" style="font-weight: bold;">2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap</a> (Level A): If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a <a href="#dfn-keyboard-interface">keyboard interface</a>, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface,
            and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit
            methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.

            ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that that content does not "trap"
               keyboard focus within subsections of content on a Web page. This is a common problem
               when multiple formats are combined within a page and rendered using plug-ins or embedded
               applications.
               
            </p>
            <p>There may be times when the functionality of the Web page restricts the focus to a
               subsection of the content, as long as the user knows how to leave that state and "untrap"
               the focus.
