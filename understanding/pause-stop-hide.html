         <p class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's

            possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to avoid distracting users during their interaction
               with a Web page.
               
            </p>
            <p>"Moving, blinking and scrolling" refers to content in which the visible content conveys
               a sense of motion. Common examples include motion pictures, synchronized media presentations,
               animations, real-time games, and scrolling stock tickers. "Auto-updating" refers to
               content that updates or disappears based on a preset time interval. Common time-based
               content includes audio, automatically updated weather information, news, stock price
               updates, and auto-advancing presentations and messages. The requirements for moving,
               blinking and scrolling content and for auto-updating content are the same except that:
               
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>authors have the option of providing the user with a means to control the frequency
                  of updates when content is auto-updating and
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>there is no five second exception for auto-updating since it makes little sense to
                  auto-update for a few seconds and then stop
                  
               </li>
               
               
            </ul>
            <p>Content that moves or auto-updates can be a barrier to anyone who has trouble reading
               stationary text quickly as well as anyone who has trouble tracking moving objects.
               It can also cause problems for screen readers.
               
            </p>
            <p>Moving content can also be a severe distraction for some people. Certain groups, particularly
               those with attention deficit disorders, find blinking content distracting, making
               it difficult for them to concentrate on other parts of the Web page. Five seconds
               was chosen because it is long enough to get a user's attention, but not so long that
               a user cannot wait out the distraction if necessary to use the page.
               
            </p>
            <p>Content that is paused can either resume in real-time or continue playing from the
               point in the presentation where the user left off.

                  <p>Pausing and resuming where the user left off is best for users who want to pause to
                     read content and works best when the content is not associated with a real-time event
                     or status.

                  <p>Pausing and jumping to current display (when pause is released) is better for information
                     that is real-time or "status" in nature. For example, weather radar, a stock ticker,
                     a traffic camera, or an auction timer, would present misleading information if a pause
                     caused it to display old information when the content was restarted.

                        <p>Hiding content would have the same result as pausing and jumping to current display
                           (when pause is released).

            <p>For a mechanism to be considered "a mechanism for the user to pause," it must provide
               the user with a means to pause that does not tie up the user or the focus so that
               the page cannot be used.  The word "pause" here is meant in the sense of a "pause
               button" although other mechanisms than a button can be used.   Having an animation
               stop only so long as a user has focus on it (where it restarts as soon as the user
               moves the focus away) would not be considered a "mechanism for the user to pause"
               because it makes the page unusable in the process and would not meet this SC.
               
            </p>
            <p>It is important to note that the terms "blinking" and "flashing" can sometimes refer
               to the same content.
               
            </p>

               <li>"Blinking" refers to content that causes a distraction problem. Blinking can be allowed
                  for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped)
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>"Flashing" refers to content that can trigger a seizure (if it is more than 3 per
                  second and large and bright enough). This cannot be allowed even for a second or it
                  could cause a seizure. And turning the flash off is also not an option since the seizure
                  could occur faster than most users could turn it off.
                  
               </li>
               
               
               <li>Blinking usually does not occur at speeds of 3 per second or more, but it can. If
                  blinking occurs faster than 3 per second, it would also be considered a flash.

               <li>Providing content that stops blinking after five seconds or providing a mechanism
                  for users to stop blinking content allows people with certain disabilities to interact

                  Although this is an effective technique for all users with vision, it can be a problem
                  for some users if it persists. For certain groups, including people with low literacy,
                  reading and intellectual disabilities, and people with attention deficit disorders,
                  content that blinks may make it difficult or even impossible to interact with the
