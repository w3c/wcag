         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#re-authenticating" style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.5 Re-authenticating</a> (Level AAA): When an authenticated session expires, the user can continue the activity without
            loss of data after re-authenticating.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow all users to complete authenticated
               transactions that have inactivity time limits or other circumstances that would cause
               a user to be logged out while in the midst of completing the transaction.
               
            </p>
            <p>For security reasons, many sites implement an authentication time limit after a certain
               period of inactivity. These time limits may cause problems for persons with disabilities
               because it may take longer for them to complete the activity. 
               
            </p>
            <p>Other sites will log a person out of a session if a person logs in on the Web site
               from another computer or if other activities arise that make the site suspicious of
               whether the person is still the same legitimate person who logged in originally. When
               users are logged out while still in the midst of a transaction - it is important that
               they be given the ability to re-authenticate and continue with the transaction without
               the loss of any data already entered.

               <li>This Success Criterion benefits people who may require additional time to complete
                  an activity. People with cognitive limitations may read slowly and require additional
                  time to read and respond to a questionnaire. Users interacting via a screen reader
                  may need extra time to navigate and complete a complicated form. 
                  A person with motor impairments or who navigates with an alternative input device
                  may require additional time to navigate through or complete input within a form.

                  a user who is deaf, control over time limits is also important.

                  <p>A user with extremely limited use of the hands is logged into a shopping site. It
                     takes so long to enter credit card information into the application that a time limit
                     occurs while the user is performing the checkout process. When the user returns to
                     the checkout process and submits the form, the site returns a login screen to re-authenticate.
                     After the user logs in, the check out process is restored with the same information
                     and at the same stage. The user did not lose any data because the server had temporarily
                     accepted and stored the submission even though the session had timed out and restored
                     the user to the same state after re-authentication was completed.

                  <p>An email program has an authentication time-out after 30 minutes. The program prompts
                     the user several minutes before the time-out occurs and provides a link to open a
                     new window in order to re-authenticate. The original window with the in-progress email
                     remains intact and, after re-authentication, the user may send that data.

                  <p>A long questionnaire provided within a single Web page has information at the beginning
                     that indicates that the session will time out after 15 minutes. The user is also informed
                     that the questionnaire can be saved at any point and completed at a later time. Within
                     the Web page there are several buttons provided to save the partially completed form.
                     In addition, with JavaScript in the list of accessibility-supported content technologies
                     that are relied upon, the user can elect to be alerted via a pop-up if the session
                     is close to timing out.
