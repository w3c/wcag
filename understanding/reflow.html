            while manipulating content. It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling
            for such parts of the content.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to support people with low vision who need
               to enlarge text and read it in a single column.  When the browser zoom is used to
               scale content to 400%, it reflows - i.e., it is presented in one column so that scrolling
               in more than one direction is not necessary.
            </p>
            <p>For people with low vision, enlarged text with reflow enables reading. It is critical.
               Enlargement enables perception of characters. Reflow enables tracking. Tracking is
               following along lines of text, including getting from the end of one line to the beginning
               of the next line.
            </p>
            <p>Avoiding the need to scroll in the direction of reading in order to reveal lines that
               are cut off by the viewport is important, because such scrolling significantly increases
               the effort required to read. It is also important that content is not hidden off-screen.
               For example, zooming into a vertically scrolling page should not cause content to
               be hidden to one side.
            </p>

               <h3>How reflow works</h3>
               
               <p>User agents for technologies such as HTML/CSS, PDF, and ePub have methods for reflowing
                  content to fit the width of the window (viewport). When appropriately authored, page
                  content can reflow (wrap) to stay within the window's boundaries (viewport) when users
                  zoom in to enlarge the size of content. Spatial relationships of content may change
                  when users zoom, but all information and functionality should continue to be available.
               </p>
               
               <p>Supporting the reflow of content is also known as 'Responsive Web Design'. It is enabled
                  by CSS media queries which reformat the web content for different viewport widths
                  (at particular break points) in order to provide optimised layouts for mobile devices
                  such as tablets or smartphones. Importantly, these breakpoints are not only triggered
                  by narrower viewports, but also when users employ the browser zoom function to zoom
                  into the page.
               </p>
               
               <p>In a desktop browser at 100% (default) scale, typical web pages that support reflow
                  display content in two, three or more columns. Zooming in will at some point trigger
                  a change of layout, so content will now be displayed in fewer columns. At a higher
                  magnification scale of 200% or more, content will usually be rendered in a single
                  column. Parts of content that were in the marginal columns, like a navigation menu
                  or supplementary content, will now typically appear on top of or below the main content.

               <h3>Viewing distance and display resolution</h3>
               
               <p>The value of 320 CSS pixels was chosen as a reasonable minimum size that authors can
                  achieve. This value lines up with the reported viewport width of small displays of
                  common mobile devices. The width of 320 CSS pixels exactly corresponds to a desktop
                  browser window set to a width of 1280px and zoomed in to 400%. It should be noted
                  that 400% applies to the dimension, not the area. It means four times the default
                  width and four times the default height.
               </p>

               <p>When we read, the size of the print is not as important as the image it projects on
                  the retina of our eye. Phones are designed for close viewing while desktops are designed
                  for viewing farther away. As a consequence 16px print on a phone is physically smaller
                  than 16px print on a desktop. This is not a problem because both print sizes cast
                  the same image on our retina if they are viewed at their intended distance.

               <h3>Visibility and availability of content</h3> 
               
               <p>How much of the content is visible may change at different scales. For example, navigation
                  menus that are fully visible in the desktop layout are often collapsed into fewer
                  items, or even into a single menu button (the 'hamburger' icon pattern) so they take
                  up less screen space.
               </p>
               
               <p>The Success Criterion is met as long as all content and functionality are still fully
                  available -  either directly, or revealed via accessible controls, or accessible via
                  direct links.

               <h3>Content exceptions for reflow</h3>
               
               <p>Content which requires two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning cannot reflow without
                  losing meaning, and is therefore out of scope of this Success Criterion. For example,
                  graphics and video are by their nature two-dimensional. Cutting up an image and stacking
                  the blocks would render the content unusable so that is out of scope. It is acceptable
                  to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content. However, it is
                  possible to have these elements stay within the bounds of viewport at zoom levels
                  to 400% (see advisory techniques).
               </p>
               
               <p>Complex data tables have a two-dimensional relationship between the headings and data
                  cells. This relationship is essential to convey the content. This Success Criterion
                  therefore does not apply to whole data tables, and it is acceptable to provide two-dimensional
                  scrolling for them.  However, cells within data tables should fit within the size
                  requirement unless the cell contains types of content that also requires two-dimensional
                  layout for usage or meaning.
               </p>
               
               <p>Interfaces which provide toolbars to edit content need to show both the content and
                  the toolbar in the viewport. Depending on the number of toolbar buttons, the toolbar
                  may need to scroll in the direction of text (e.g., horizontally in a vertically scrolling
                  page). This Success Criterion therefore does not apply to interfaces which provide
                  toolbars.

               <h3>Responsive web design and other ways to meet this Success Criterion</h3>
               
               <p>Using the responsive web design approach is the most effective method of achieving
                  the goal of allowing people to zoom in to 400%. Each variation (CSS break point) of
                  the page at the same URL should conform (compare <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#h-note-27">Conformance for WCAG 2.1</a>).
               </p>
               
               <p>For organisations which are using legacy systems or are not able to update their layout
                  methods for some reason, an alternative conforming version could be a mobile site
                  which has a fixed 320px wide layout. The user should be able to find that version
                  from the default website.

               <h3>Avoiding scrolling in horizontally and vertically written languages</h3>
               
               <p>The success Criterion applies to both horizontally and vertically written languages.
                  Zooming the page for horizontally written languages where pages scroll vertically
                  by default (e.g. English) should not require horizontal scrolling. Zooming the page
                  for vertically written languages which scroll horizontally by default should not require
                  vertical scrolling.

               <h3>The relation of Reflow to the Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text</h3>
               
               <p>The focus of the Reflow Success Criterion is to enable users to zoom in without having
                  to scroll in two directions. <a href="resize-text" class="sc">Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text</a> also applies, so it should be possible to increase the size of all text to at least
                  200% while simultaneously meeting the reflow requirement. For most implementations,
                  the text is expected to continue to enlarge as the magnification increases, so that
                  users can magnify text up to (and beyond) 400%. In an implementation where text does
                  not consistently increase its size as people zoom in (such as when it is tranformed
                  based on a media query to adapt to small-screen usage), it must still be possible
                  to get to 200% enlargement in order to satisfy the Resize Text criterion.
               </p>
               
               <p>For example, if at the default browser setting of 100% zoom, text is set at 20px when
                  the window is 1280px wide, the same 20px at 200% zoom would mean a text size of 200%.
                  At 400% zoom, the author may decide to set the text size to 10px: the text would now
                  still be enlarged to 200% compared to the default browser setting of 100% zoom. It
                  is not required to achieve 200% text enlargement at every breakpoint, but it should
                  be possible to get 200% text enlargement in some way.

               <h3>Browsers on mobile operating systems</h3>
               
               <p>Most browsers on mobile operating systems do not combine reflow and zoom in the same
                  way as on desktop browsers. These mobile browsers normally support reflow when changing
                  the orientation of the device -- content will be adjusted to the new viewport width.
                  However, these mobile browsers can only magnify content to achieve 1.4.4. Resize Text
                  in manners which do not constrain reflow to a single dimension, for example by using
                  a pinch gesture to scale up content or a double tap on a particular column to make
                  it fill the viewport width. This means that zoomed content in most mobile browsers
                  involves two-dimensional scrolling regardless of what an author does.
               </p>
               
               <p>Mobile user agents <em>can</em> offer reflow when users zoom into content, as evidenced by the Dolphin browser for
                  Android. The lack of magnified reflow support in browsers on mobile operating systems
                  can therefore be regarded as a user agent support issue.
