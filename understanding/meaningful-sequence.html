            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable a user agent to provide an alternative
               presentation of content while preserving the reading order needed to understand the
               meaning. It is important that it be possible to programmatically determine at least
               one sequence of the content that makes sense. Content that does not meet this Success
               Criterion may confuse or disorient users when assistive technology reads the content
               in the wrong order, or when alternate style sheets or other formatting changes are
               applied.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>A sequence is 
               <em>meaningful</em> if the order of content in the sequence cannot be changed without affecting its meaning.
               
               For example, if a page contains two independent articles, the relative order of the
               articles may not affect their meaning, as long as they are not interleaved. In such
               a situation, the articles themselves may have meaningful sequence, but the container
               that contains the articles may not have a meaningful sequence.
               
            </p>
            <p>The semantics of some elements define whether or not their content is a meaningful
               sequence. For instance, in HTML, text is always a meaningful sequence. Tables and
               ordered lists are meaningful sequences, but unordered lists are not.
               
            </p>
            <p>The order of content in a sequence is not always meaningful. For example, the relative
               order of the main section of a Web page and a navigation section does not affect their
               meaning. They could occur in either order in the programmatically determined reading
               sequence. As another example, a magazine article contains several callout sidebars.
               The order of the article and the sidebars does not affect their meaning. In these
               cases there are a number of different reading orders for a Web page that can satisfy
               the Success Criterion. 
               
               
            </p>
            <p>For clarity:</p>
            <ol>
               
               
               <li>Providing a particular linear order is only required where it affects meaning.</li>
               
               
               <li>There may be more than one order that is "correct" (according to the WCAG 2.0 definition).</li>
               
               
               <li>Only one correct order needs to be provided.</li>

               <li>This Success Criterion may help people who rely on assistive technologies that read
                  content aloud. The meaning evident in the sequencing of the information in the default
                  presentation will be the same when the content is presented in spoken form.

               <li> 
                  
                  <strong>Example 1:</strong> In a multi-column document, the linear presentation of the content flows from the
                  top of a column to the bottom of the column, then to the top of the next column.

                  <strong>Example 2:</strong> CSS is used to position a navigation bar, the main story on a page, and a side story.
                  The visual presentation of the sections does not match the programmatically determined
                  order, but the meaning of the page does not depend on the order of the sections.
