            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and
               its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do
               not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies,
               hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading
               performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast
               somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way
               that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will
               also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.
               
            </p>
            <p>Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random
               words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted
               without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this
               criterion. 
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast.
               The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to
               use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of
               pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large
               enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the
               Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large
               Print under 
               <a href="#resources">Resources</a>). "18 point" and "bold" can both have different meanings in different fonts but,
               except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there are
               so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding fancy
               or thin fonts is included.

                  <p>When evaluating this success criterion, the font size in points should be obtained
                     from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way that user agents do.
                     Point sizes are based on the CSS pt size as defined in 
                     <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#reference-pixel">CSS3 Values</a>. The ratio between sizes in points and CSS pixels is 1pt = 1.333px, therefore 14pt
                     and 18pt are equivalent to approximately 18.5px and 24px.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities
                     (e.g. 72 PPI or 96 PPI), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an image editing
                     application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size.
                     When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the
                     resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the
                     default size for body text. For example, for a 72 PPI image, an author would need
                     to use approximately 19 pt and 24 pt font sizes in order to successfully present images
                     of large-scale text to a user. 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
               </div>
            </div>
            <p>The previously-mentioned contrast requirements for text also apply to images of text
               (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) as stated
               in Success Criterion 1.4.3.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be
               understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include
               a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be
               invisible to all viewers. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated
               in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content
               in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are
               not included in the exception.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>In this provision there is an exception that reads "that are part of a picture that
               contains significant other visual content,". This exception is intended to separate
               pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text
               in order to get a particular look.

                  <p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate. It is also
                     harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images
                     of text, which is necessary for some users. Therefore, we suggest using text wherever
                     possible, and when not, consider supplying an image of higher resolution.

            <p>The minimum contrast success criterion (1.4.3) applies to text in the page, including
               placeholder text and text that is shown when a pointer is hovering over an object
               or when an object has keyboard focus. If any of these are used in a page, the text
               needs to provide sufficient contrast.
               
            </p>
            <p>Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for content
               presented in charts, graphs, diagrams, and other non-text-based information.
               Content presented in this manner should also have good contrast to ensure that more
               users can access the information.

               <p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital
                  and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than
                  for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are
                  different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing
                  effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not
                  feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast
                  that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution
                  is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses.
                  The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without
                  regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength
                  colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia.

                        low contrast, and therefore we allow and encourage authors to provide mechanisms to
                        adjust the foreground and background colors of the content. Some of the combinations
                        that could be chosen may have contrast levels that will be lower than those found

                        there is a mechanism that will return to the default values set out in the Success

               <p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]]
                  for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in this provision to account
                  for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity, congenital
                  or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that typically
                  accompanies aging.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable
                  contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding
                  that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity
                  loss of roughly 1.5 [[ARDITI-FAYE]]. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast
                  ratio of 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1.  Following
                  analogous empirical findings and the same logic, the user with 20/80 visual acuity
                  would require contrast of about 7:1.
                  
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the
                  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent
                  to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is
                  commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. [[GITTINGS-FOZARD]]

               <p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the
                  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent
                  to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually
                  use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies
                  usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them).
                  The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity
                  experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides
                  contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.

               <p>Conversion from nonlinear to linear RGB values is based on IEC/4WD 61966-2-1 [[IEC-4WD]]
                  and on "A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet - sRGB" [[sRGB]].
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The formula (L1/L2) for contrast is based on [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]]
                  standards.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard calls for the contribution from ambient light to be
                  included in the calculation of L1 and L2. The .05 value used is based on Typical Viewing
                  Flare from [[IEC-4WD]] and the [[sRGB]] paper by M. Stokes et al.

               <p>This Success Criterion and its definitions use the terms "contrast ratio" and "relative
                  luminance" rather than "luminance" to reflect the fact that Web content does not emit
                  light itself. The contrast ratio gives a measure of the relative luminance that would
                  result when displayed. (Because it is a ratio, it is dimensionless.)

               <li>People with low vision often have difficulty reading text that does not contrast with
                  its background. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency
                  that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a minimum luminance contrast ratio
                  between the text and its background can make the text more readable even if the person
                  does not see the full range of colors. It also works for the rare individuals who
                  see no color.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.

                     <p>The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined
                        size and the user's display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text
                        fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150%
                        of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors
                        would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in
                        relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display.
                        The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font
                        metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who
                        have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.

                     <p>When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major
                        browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If
                        a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would
                        be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from
                        the default sizes in a similar fashion.
