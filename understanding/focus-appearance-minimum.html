         <ul>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Contrasting area:</strong>  There is an area of the <a href="#dfn-focus-indicator">focus indicator</a> that has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the colors in the focused and unfocused
               states.

            <li>
               <strong>Minimum area:</strong> The contrasting area is at least as large as:

            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> The contrasting area also has a contrast ratio of least 3:1 against adjacent colors
               in the focused component, or the contrasting area has a thickness of at least 2 CSS
               pixels.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Not fully obscured:</strong> The item with focus is not entirely hidden by author-created content.
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do
            not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal
            to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.
         </p>
         <p class="note">If the component has a visible boundary smaller than the hit area, or the size of
            the component is not available, the minimum area can be taken from the visible boundary.
         </p>
         <p class="ednote">The working group is interested in feedback about the minimum area metric, and if
            there are unusual scenarios where visible indicators are caught by the wording.

            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is clearly
               visible and discernible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible.html">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a>. Where Focus Visible merely requires a visible focus indicator, 2.4.11 defines a
               minimum level of visibility. Where Non-text Contrast requires a component to have
               adequate contrast against the background in each of its states, 2.4.11 requires sufficient
               contrast <em>between</em> the focused and unfocused states.
            </p>
            <p>For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard-like device (e.g.,
               a switch, voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. Visible
               focus must also meet the needs of low-vision users, who may also be keyboard-only
               users.
            </p>
            <p>A keyboard focus indicator can take different forms; this Success Criterion sets a
               requirement to make it clearly distinguishable. For example, using a thick outline
               that contrasts with the background would pass this criterion.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>The default focus indicators in some browsers can be difficult to see, such as a 1
               pixel dotted outline, or a blue indicator which happens to be on a blue background.It
               is generally best to either define a keyboard focus style which meets this criterion,
               or test the focus styles across the browsers that are relied upon for conformance.

               <h3>Keyboard focus</h3>
               
               <p>The keyboard focus is the point of interaction for someone using a keyboard. For environments
                  with a keyboard-operable interface, the keyboard focus can be moved around the interface
                  in order to interact with different elements. Whichever element is being interacted
                  with has focus.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Some components have sub-components that can take focus, such as the menu items on
                  a menu. The item considered to be focused is whichever is being interacted with. For
                  example, if you tab to a menu and arrow down to a menu item, it is the menu item that
                  is in focus; pressing Enter would activate the menu item.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Some non-operable elements can take focus (such as a heading element that is the target
                  of a skip link); however, it is only when the element with focus is operable by keyboard
                  that this Success Criterion applies.

               <h3>Minimum area</h3>
               
               
               <p>The bigger the visible change when an item receives focus, the easier it is for someone
                  to see. Authors are encouraged to make the change as significant as possible, for
                  example, by designing a thick border around the element.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The Success Criterion defines a minimum area using a calculation for perimeter, and
                  a secondary minumum based on the shortest side side of the control.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>For the first calculation, the minimum area of the focus indicator must be at least
                  as large as the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter (border) of the control in its
                  unfocussed state. The indicator does not have to be a border, but the indicator's
                  area must be at least as large. For example, if a control is a rectangle of 90px wide
                  and 30px tall, the size of the outer border is 90 + 90 + 30 + 30 = 240 CSS pixels.
                  You then must subtract the 4 corner pixels (which are counted twice, both horizontally
                  and vertically), for a total minimum area of 236 CSS pixels.
               </p>

                  <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="4">Note</div>
                  <p>A <a href="#dfn-css-pixel">CSS pixel</a> is what developers use in CSS declarations like “width: 200px”, it is device-independent
                     and not to be confused with device pixels which vary depending on the physical pixel
                     density. <br />
                     The rest of this document notates CSS pixels as "px".

               <p>The following 3 examples use a 90px wide by 30px tall button, therefore the surface
                  area requirement is 236px (240px minus corner 4 pixels). The middle button is focused
                  in each example.

                  <figcaption>Figure 2  The inner outline is slightly smaller than the outer edge of the component (236px
                     minus 2px on each side), but using a 2px thick indicator means it is well over the
                     minimum requirement of 236px squared.

                  <figcaption>Figure 3  The thick (3px) yellow underline is almost as long as the longest edge, 80px multiplied
                     by 3px exceeds the requirement of 236px squared.

               <p>If controls change size across different variations of a page (e.g., in a responsive
                  design), it helps to use a proportionally sized indicator such as an outline or background
                  change. In that way you can be sure of meeting the size requirement.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The Success Criterion includes an alternative size measure of "at least as large as
                  a 4 CSS pixels border along the shortest side, and no thinner than 2 CSS pixels.".
                  This is included to allow for smaller but thick indicators. For example, some controls
                  might be of a fixed height but variable width, in which case this measure allows for
                  a more consistent approach. Although the area is less than the primary measure, the
                  minimum thickness helps to maintain the visibility.

               <p>Typical focus indicators:</p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>A solid outline around the whole component would pass the size requirement;</li>
                  
                  <li>A 1 CSS pixel dotted outline around the whole component would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement, as it is roughly 50% of the surface area of a solid line.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>Changing the background of a control would pass the size requirement;</li>
                  
                  <li>A 1px wide vertical line (such as a blinking cursor) would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement, a text input would need a larger or separate focus indicator.
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               
               <p>If you need to use complex mathematics to work out if a focus indicator is large enough,
                  it is probably a sign that you should use a larger and proportional indicator that
                  will provide a more visible indicator.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Where a focus indicator is defined in code as a certain size, e.g. 2px thickness,
                  anti-aliasing can be ignored for the purposes of calculation. Dotted or dashed outlines
                  have various levels of gaps depending on the browser, screen density, and thickness.
                  For example, in most browsers a "dotted" line will have roughly half the number of
                  pixels due to gaps. However, in some sizes or browsers it might be slightly less than
                  half, so increasing the thickness may be required.
               </p>

                  <p>If you have an unusual shape, some mathematics may be required if the focus indicator
                     is on the edge of the size requirement. For example, if the focusable control is a
                     circle with a diameter of 100px, the circumference would be 314 pixels. A 1px (or
                     greater) outline would meet the size criterion.

                     The size of the ring's dark outline is large enough to meet the <strong>Minimum area</strong> requirement of 2.4.11 Focus Appearance. The color of the pixels making up the ring's
                     outline versus the same pixels in the unfocused state meets the 2.4.11 <strong>Change of contrast</strong> bullet. The ring's outline also contrasts against the inside shading (another more
                     subtle indicator of focus), so both the inner and outer edges of the ring's outline

                     and the teal color of the checkbox is sufficient to pass the 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast
                     requirement to identify its (checked) state.

                     against the light page background and, on its adjacent inner edge, against the shading.
                     (The color difference between the grey of the unchecked box and the teal of the checked
                     version is irrelevant to the assessment. Since the tick mark indicates the checked

                     <li>The blue focus indicator, although not contrasting with the black checkbox border,
                        has a thickness of 2 CSS pixels and so meets <strong>Adjacent contrast</strong>.

                  The focused state contrasts with the white background, so the component continues
                  to pass 1.4.11.
