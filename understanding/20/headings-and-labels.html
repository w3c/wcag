     <h2>Intent of Headings and Labels</h2>
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to help users understand what information
         is contained in web pages and how that information is organized. When headings are
         clear and descriptive, users can find the information they seek more easily, and they
         can understand the relationships between different parts of the content more easily.
         Descriptive labels help users identify specific components within the content.
      </p>
      
      <p>Labels and headings do not need to be lengthy. A word, or even a single character,
         may suffice if it provides an appropriate cue to finding and navigating content.
      </p>
       <p>Labels of form controls are usually text-based. In some cases, images can serve as descriptive labels without additional text. In these cases, authors should ensure that the image and its use as a label (in context) are widely understood.</p>
         <p>Note that the same image can be interpreted differently in different contexts. However, it can still be considered descriptive if its use is commonly understood in each context. For example, when accompanying a text field, a loupe or magnifying glass icon with text alternative of "Search" is commonly interpreted as indicating the field is for entering and submitting a search query.</p>
        <p>Placed on or near another image, a loupe or magnifying glass icon is commonly interpreted as a means to view a magnified version of the image (for instance, acting as a mechanism to zoom into the image, or opening a full-sized image in a new window).</p>
      
      <p>This success criterion requires that if headings or labels are provided, they be descriptive. This success criterion does not require headings or labels; labels for inputs are covered separately by <a href="labels-or-instructions">3.3.2 Labels or Instructions</a>.  This success criterion also
         does not require that content acting as a heading or label be correctly marked up or
         identified — that aspect is covered separately by
         <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>. It is possible for content
         to pass this success criterion (providing descriptive content that acts as headings or labels) while failing
         Success Criterion 1.3.1 (if the headings or labels aren't correctly marked up/identified). Conversely,
         it is also possible for content to pass Success Criterion 1.3.1 (with headings or labels correctly
         marked up or identified), while failing this success criterion (if those headings or labels are inaccurate or insufficiently clear).
      </p>
      <p>Further, in the case of labels, this success criterion does not take into consideration whether or not
         alternative methods of providing an accessible name for form controls and inputs have been
         used — that aspect is covered separately by <a href="name-role-value">4.1.2 Name, Role and Value</a>. It is possible
         for controls and inputs to have an appropriate accessible name (e.g. using <code>aria-label="…"</code>)
         and therefore pass Success Criterion 4.1.2, but to still fail this success criterion (if the label is inaccurate or insufficiently clear or descriptive).
      </p>
      <p>This success criterion does not require the use of labels; however, it does require that if labels are present, they must be accurate and sufficiently clear or descriptive. Please see <a href="labels-or-instructions">3.3.2 Labels or Instructions</a> for more information on the use of labels.

      <h2>Benefits of Headings and Labels</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>Descriptive headings are especially helpful for users who have disabilities that make
            reading slow and for people with limited short-term memory. These people benefit when
            section titles make it possible to predict what each section contains.</li>
         <li>Form input controls with labels that clearly and accurately describe the content that is expected to be
            entered helps users know how to successfully complete the form.</li>
         <li>When headings and labels are also correctly marked up and identified in accordance with
            <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>, this success criterion
            helps people who use screen readers by ensuring that labels and headings are clearer when
            presented in a different format — for example, in an automatically generated list of
            headings, a table of contents, or when jumping from heading to heading within a page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples of Headings and Labels</h2>
      
      <dl>
         <dt>A news site</dt>
         <dd>The home page of a news site lists the headlines for the top stories of the hour.
               Under each heading are the first 35 words of the story and a link to the full article.
               Each headline gives a clear and accurate idea of the article's subject.</dd>
         <dt>A guide on how to write well</dt>
         <dd>A guide on writing contains the following section titles: <q>How To Write Well</q>,
               <q>Cut Out Useless Words</q>, <q>Identify Unnecessary Words</q>, and so on.
               The section headings are clear and concise and the structure of the information is
               accurately reflected in the structure of the headings.</dd>
         <dt>Consistent headings in different articles</dt>
         <dd>A website contains papers from a conference. Submissions to the conference are required
               to have the following organization: <q>Summary</q>, <q>Introduction</q>, [other sections unique
               to this article], <q>Conclusion</q>, <q>Author Biography</q>, <q>Glossary</q>, and <q>Bibliography</q>.
               The title of each web page clearly identifies the article it contains, creating a useful balance
               between the uniqueness of the articles and the consistency of the section headings.</dd>
         <dt>A form asking for the name of the user</dt>
         <dd>A form asks for the name of the user. It consists of two input fields to ask for the first
               and last name. The first field is labeled <q>First name</q>, the second is labeled <q>Last name</q>.</dd>
         <dt>A search field labeled by a magnifying glass icon</dt>
         <dd>A search text input is followed by a button containing a magnifying glass icon that activates the search function. 
               The icon has the string "search" as programmatically determinable label.</dd>
