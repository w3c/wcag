      <h2>Intent of Unusual Words</h2>
      
      
      <p>Certain disabilities make it difficult to understand non-literal word usage and specialized
         words or usage. Certain disabilities make it difficult to understand figurative language
         or specialized usage. Providing such mechanisms is vital for these audiences. Specialized
         information intended for non-specialist readers is encouraged to satisfy this Success
         Criterion, even when claiming only Single-A or Double-A conformance.

      <h2>Benefits of Unusual Words</h2>
      
      
      <p>This success criterion may help people with cognitive, language and learning disabilities
         who:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>have difficulty decoding words</li>
         
         <li>have difficulty understanding words and phrases</li>
         
         <li>have difficulty using context to aid understanding</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>It would also help people with visual disabilities who:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>lose context when zoomed-in with a screen magnifier</li>

      <dl>
         <dt>Text that includes a definition for a word used in an unusual way</dt>
         <dd>Organize the list or "cascade" of dictionaries and other resources so that the definition
               search will find the intended definitions instead of displaying definitions from other
               sources in the "cascade." (The "cascade" lists the dictionaries and other reference
               materials in the order most likely to bring up the right definition. This controls
               the order to follow when searching for definitions.)</dd>
         <dt>Including definitions in the glossary</dt>
         <dd>WCAG 2 uses the word "text" in a specific way. Thus, when the word "text" is used
               within WCAG 2 it is linked to the definition of "text" provided in a glossary within
               the same web page.</dd>
         <dt>The specific definition of a word is provided at the bottom of the page</dt>
         <dd>The internal link from the word to the corresponding definition is also provided within the page.</dd>
