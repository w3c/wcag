   <h1>Understanding Use of Color</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Use of Color</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access information
         that is conveyed by color differences, that is, by the use of color where each color
         has a meaning assigned to it. If the information is conveyed through color differences
         in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color
         deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through
         another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.
      </p>
      
      <p>Color is an important asset in design of Web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal,
         its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving
         color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older
         users do not see color well. In addition, people using text-only, limited-color or
         monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented
         only in color.
      </p>
      
      <p>Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields are red",
         “error is shown in red", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's are in blue". Examples
         of indications of an action include: using color to indicate that a link will open
         in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully. An example
         of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that
         a required field had been left blank.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
         
         <p>This should not in any way discourage the use of color on a page, or even color coding if it is redundant with other visual indication.

         <li>Users with partial sight often experience limited color vision.</li>
         
         <li>Some older users may not be able to see color well.</li>
         
         <li>Users who have color-blindness benefit when information conveyed by color is available
            in other visual ways.

         <li>People using text-only, limited color, or monochrome displays may be unable to access
            color-dependent information.
         </li>
         
         <li>Users who have problems distinguishing between colors can look or listen for text
            cues.
         </li>
         
         <li>People using Braille displays or other tactile interfaces can detect text cues by
            touch.

      <h2>Examples of Use of Color</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>A form that uses color and text to indicate required fields</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A form contains both required and optional fields. Instructions at the top of the
               form explain that required fields are labeled with red text and also with an icon
               whose text alternative says, "Required." Both the red text and the icon are programmatically
               associated with the appropriate form fields so that assistive technology users can
               determine the required fields. 
               
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>

               <strong> An examination.</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>Students view an SVG image of a chemical compound and identify the chemical elements
               present based on the colors and numbers used in the diagram. The text alternatives
               associated with each element name the color of the element and indicate the element's
               position in the diagram. Students who cannot perceive color have the same information
               about the compound as their classmates. (This technique also satisfies 
               <a href="non-text-content" class="guideline">Guideline 1.1</a> Level A.)
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong> Disabled Form elements.</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Form elements which are disabled via markup or scripting, are greyed out and made
               inactive by the user agent. When in the disabled state these elements do not receive
               focus. Assistive technologies can programmatically determine the state of disabled
               elements and will provide this information to the user as the elements are encountered
               on the page. The change in color and loss of focus provides redundant, visual information
               about the state of the control.
