   <h1>Understanding Use of Color</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Use of Color</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all sighted users can access information
         that is conveyed by color differences, that is, by the use of color where each color
         has a meaning assigned to it. If the information is conveyed through color differences
         in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color
         deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through
         another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.
      </p>
      
      <p>Color is an important asset in design of Web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal,
         its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving
         color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older
         users do not see color well. In addition, people using limited-color or
         monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented
         only in color.
      </p>
      
      <p>Examples of information conveyed by color differences: required fields are only identified
         by changing their border to a red color; sales figures for different employees are only
         visually distinguished by using different foreground colors( e.g. Mary's sales are in red,
         Tom's are in blue). Examples of indications of an action include: using color to indicate
         that a link will open in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully.
         An example of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that
         a required field had been left blank. Examples of distinguishing a visual element:
         for a series of toggle buttons, the pressed/activated buttons are only visually indicated
         by a difference in color; the interactive element that currently has focus is only
         distinguished by changing the color of the element's <em>existing</em> background or
         border - however, if focus indication introduces a new visual element that was not previously
         present, this does not count as a change in color, since the indicator was not presentation
         to begin with.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
         
         <p>This should not in any way discourage the use of color on a page, or even color coding if it is complemented by other visual indication.
         </p>
         
      </div>


      <div class="note">

         <p>If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in their hue,
            but that also have a significant difference in lightness, then this counts as an additional
            visual distinction, as long as the difference in relative luminance between the colors leads
            to a contrast ratio of 3:1 or greater.
            For example, a light green and a dark red differ <strong>both</strong> by color (hue)
            <strong>and</strong> by lightness, so they would pass if the contrast ratio is at least 3:1.
            Similarly, if content is distinguished by inverting an element's foreground and background colors,
            this would pass (again, assuming that the foreground and background colors have a sufficient contrast).
         </p>
         <p>However, if content relies on the user's ability to accurately perceive or differentiate a particular color
            an additional visual indicator will be required regardless of the contrast ratio between those colors. For example, 
           knowing whether an outline is green for valid or red for invalid.
         </p>

      </div>

      <div class="note">

         <p>This criterion does not directly address the needs of users with assistive technologies.
            It aims to ensure that sighted users who cannot distinguish between some colors can still
            understand content.
            How information is conveyed to assistive technology users is covered separately in other
            criteria, including (but not limited to)
            <a href="non-text-content">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>,
            <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>, and
            <a href="name-role-value">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>.
         </p>
         <p>Conversely, even if information that is conveyed by color differences is appropriately conveyed
            to assistive technologies, it does not necessarily pass this criterion, as sighted users who cannot
            distinguish between certain color may not necessarily be using any assistive technologies. This
            criterion requires a visible alternative to color.

               <strong>A form that uses color and text to indicate required fields</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A form contains both required and optional fields. Instructions at the top of the
               form explain that required fields are labeled with red text and also with an icon.
               Users who cannot perceive the difference between the optional field labels and the
               red labels for the required fields will still be able to see the icon next to the
               red labels.

            </p>
            
            <p>Students view an SVG image of a chemical compound and identify the chemical elements
               present based <strong>both</strong> on the colors used, as well as numbers next to each
               element. A legend shows the color and number for each type of element. Sighted users who
               cannot perceive all the color differences can still understand the image by relying on
               the numbers.

               <strong>A series of toggle buttons</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Users are presented with a series of toggle buttons that can be turned on or off. Visually,
               when a toggle button is turned on, it not only has a different background color, but is
               also styled to appear "pressed", with a distinctive inner shadow. Alternatively, toggles that
               are turned on could have an extra "ticked" icon to distinguish them from toggles that are
               turned off.

               <strong>Focus indication</strong>
            </p>
            <p>When an interactive control (like a button, toggle, or checkbox) receives focus, its background color
               changes. In addition to this, an additional outline (which was not present in the control's unfocused state)
               appears around the control.
            </p>
            <p>Note that when it comes to focus indication, there are additional criteria
               that apply. For instance, in this case, the additional outline will pass this criterion - as it provides
               another visual cue to distinguish the focused element - but the outline itself will still need to pass
