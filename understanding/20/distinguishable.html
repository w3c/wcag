      <p>While some guidelines are focused on making information available in a form that can
         be presented in alternate formats, this guideline is concerned with making the default
         presentation as easy to perceive as possible to people with disabilities. The primary
         focus is on making it easier for users to separate foreground information from the
         background. For visual presentations this involves making sure that information presented
         on top of a background contrasts sufficiently with the background. For audio presentations
         this involves making sure that foreground sounds are sufficiently louder than the
         background sounds. Individuals with visual and hearing disabilities have much greater
         difficulty separating foreground and background information.
