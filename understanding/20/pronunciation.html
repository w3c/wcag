   <h1>Understanding Pronunciation</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Pronunciation</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help people who are blind, people who have
         low vision, and people with reading disabilities to understand content in cases where
         meaning depends on pronunciation. Often words or characters have different meanings,
         each with its own pronunciation. The meaning of such words or characters can usually
         be determined from the context of the sentence. However, for more complex or ambiguous
         sentences, or for some languages, the meaning of the word cannot be easily determined
         or determined at all without knowing the pronunciation. When the sentence is read
         aloud and the screen reader reads the word using the wrong pronunciation, it can be
         even more difficult to understand than when read visually. When words are ambiguous
         or indeterminate unless the pronunciation is known, then providing some means of determining
         the pronunciation is needed.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         	For example, in the English language heteronyms are words that are spelled the same
         but have different pronunciations and meanings, such as the words desert (abandon)
         and desert (arid region). If the proper pronunciation can be determined from the context
         of the sentence, then nothing is required.  If it cannot then some mechanism for determining
         the proper pronunciation would be required. Additionally, in some languages certain
         characters can be pronounced in different ways. In Japanese, for example, there are
         characters like Han characters(Kanji) that have multiple pronunciations. Screen readers
         may speak the characters incorrectly without the information on pronunciation. When
         read incorrectly, the content will not make sense to users.

            <p>Web content in Japanese provides kana (Japanese phonetic syllabary characters) written
               next to Han characters (Kanji)  show the pronunciation of a person's name. The kana
               is provided to users in parentheses right after the word. Giving the reading of the
               words written in Han characters (Kanji) allows both sighted users and screen readers
               to read/pronounce the words correctly. Note that screen readers will speak the word
               twice: the Han characters (Kanji) that can be pronounced in a wrong way are read first
               and then kana is spoken in order to provide the correct reading.

            <p>Web content using XHTML 1.1 provides kana (phonetic syllabary characters) written
               above the characters to show the reading (pronunciation) of the words by using the
