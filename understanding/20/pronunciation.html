      <h2>Intent of Pronunciation</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help people who are blind, people who have
         low vision, and people with reading disabilities to understand content in cases where
         meaning depends on pronunciation. Often words or characters have different meanings,
         each with its own pronunciation. The meaning of such words or characters can usually
         be determined from the context of the sentence. However, for more complex or ambiguous
         sentences, or for some languages, the meaning of the word cannot be easily determined
         or determined at all without knowing the pronunciation. When the sentence is read
         aloud and the screen reader reads the word using the wrong pronunciation, it can be
         even more difficult to understand than when read visually. When words are ambiguous
         or indeterminate unless the pronunciation is known, then providing some means of determining
         the pronunciation is needed.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         	For example, in the English language heteronyms are words that are spelled the same
         but have different pronunciations and meanings, such as the words desert (abandon)
         and desert (arid region). If the proper pronunciation can be determined from the context
         of the sentence, then nothing is required.  If it cannot then some mechanism for determining
         the proper pronunciation would be required. Additionally, in some languages certain
         characters can be pronounced in different ways. In Japanese, for example, there are
         characters like Han characters(Kanji) that have multiple pronunciations. Screen readers
         may speak the characters incorrectly without the information on pronunciation. When
         read incorrectly, the content will not make sense to users.

      <h2>Benefits of Pronunciation</h2>
      
      
      <p>This Success Criterion may help people who: 
         
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>have difficulty decoding words</li>
         
         <li>have difficulty using context to aid understanding</li>
         
         <li>use technologies that read the words aloud</li>

      <h2>Examples of Pronunciation</h2>
      
      <dl>
         <dt>Giving the reading of a person's name</dt>
         <dd>Web content in Japanese provides kana (Japanese phonetic syllabary characters) written
               next to Han characters (Kanji)  show the pronunciation of a person's name. The kana
               is provided to users in parentheses right after the word. Giving the reading of the
               words written in Han characters (Kanji) allows both sighted users and screen readers
               to read/pronounce the words correctly. Note that screen readers will speak the word
               twice: the Han characters (Kanji) that can be pronounced in a wrong way are read first
               and then kana is spoken in order to provide the correct reading.</dd>
         <dt>Showing the reading of the words by ruby element</dt>
         <dd>Web content using HTML provides kana (phonetic syllabary characters) written
               above the characters to show the reading (pronunciation) of the words by using the
               ruby element.</dd>
         <dt>Providing sound files of the pronunciation</dt>
         <dd>A document includes some words whose meaning cannot be determined without knowing
               the correct pronunciation. Each word is linked to a sound file that gives the correct
               pronunciation. Users can select these links to find out how to pronounce the words.</dd>
         <dt>Including pronunciation information in the glossary</dt>
         <dd>A Web page includes a glossary section. Some items in the glossary include pronunciation
               information as well as definitions. Words in the content whose meaning cannot be determined
               without knowing their pronunciation are linked to the appropriate entries in the glossary.</dd>
         <dt>Text that includes pronunciation information for characters shared by several languages
                  but pronounced differently in each language</dt>
         <dd>A Japanese university Web site includes several short phrases quoted from scholarly
               texts in Chinese and Korean. The quotations are written using the same script as the
               Japanese text. Pronunciation information is provided to show the correct reading of
               the Chinese and Korean characters.</dd>

      <div class="note">
         
         <p>For Japanese, the ruby element is used for showing the "reading" rather than "pronunciation."
