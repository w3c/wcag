      <h2>Intent of Images of Text (No Exception)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who require a particular
         visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the text presentation as required.
         This includes people who require the text in a particular font size, foreground and
         background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.
      </p>
      
      <p>This means implementing the text in a manner that allows its presentation to be changed
         or providing a mechanism by which users can select an alternate presentation. Using
         images of text is an example of an implementation that does not allow users to alter
         the presentation of the text within it.
      </p>
      
      <p>In some situations, a particular visual presentation of the text is essential to the
         information being conveyed. This means that information would be lost without that
         particular visual presentation. In this case implementing the text in a manner that
         allows its presentation to be changed is not required. This includes text that demonstrates
         a particular visual aspect of the text, such as a particular font family, or text
         that conveys an identity, such as text within a company logo.
      </p>
      
      <p>Text that is decorative does not require implementing the text in a manner that allows
         its presentation to be changed.
      </p>
      
      <p>The definition of image of text contains the note: Note: This does not include text that is part of a picture that contains significant
         other visual content. Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams which visually
         convey important information through more than just text.
      </p>

            authored line spacing and/or alignment).

      <h2>Examples of Images of Text (No Exception)</h2>
      
      <dl>
         <dt>A quote</dt>
         <dd>A Web page contains a quote. The quote itself is presented as italicized text, indented
               from the left margin. The name of the person to whom the quote is attributed is below
               the quote with 1.5x the line space and further indented from the left margin. CSS
               is used to position the text; set the spacing between lines; as well as display the
               text's font family, size, color and decoration.</dd>
         <dt>Navigation items</dt>
         <dd>A Web page contains a menu of navigation links that have both an icon and text to
               describe their target. CSS is used to display the text's font family, size and foreground
               and background colors; as well as the spacing between the navigation links.</dd>
         <dt>A logo containing text</dt>
         <dd>A Web site contains the organization's logo in the top left corner of each Web page.
               The logo contains logotype (text as part, or all, of the logo). The visual presentation
               of the text is essential to the identity of the logo and is included as a gif image
               which does not allow the text characteristics to be changed. The image has a text
               alternative.</dd>
         <dt>Representation of a font family</dt>
         <dd>A Web page contains information about a particular font family. Substituting the font
               family with another font would defeat the purpose of the representation. The representation
               is included as a jpeg image which does not allow the text characteristics to be changed.
               The image has a text alternative.</dd>
         <dt>A representation of a letter</dt>
         <dd>A Web page contains a representation of an original letter. The depiction of the letter
               in its original format is essential to information being conveyed about the time period
               in which it was written. The letter is included as a gif image which does not allow
               the text characteristics to be changed. The image has a text alternative.</dd>
         <dt>Symbolic text characters</dt>
         <dd>A form allows users to enter blocks of text. The form provides a number of buttons,
               including functions to style the text and check spelling. Some of the buttons use
               text characters that do not form a sequence that expresses something in human language.
               For example "B" to increase font weight, "I" to italicize the text and "ABC" to check
               the spelling. The symbolic text characters are included as gif images which do not
               allow the text characteristics to be changed. The buttons have text alternatives.</dd>
