      <h2>Intent of Audio Description (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to provide people who are blind or visually
         impaired access to the visual information in a synchronized media presentation in the same <a>human language</a> as the video or page on which it appears. The
         audio description augments the audio portion of the presentation with the information
         needed when the video portion is not available. During existing pauses in dialogue,
         audio description provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, and
         on-screen text that are important and are not described or spoken in the main sound
         track.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>
            For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the important information in the video track is already
            conveyed in the audio track, no additional audio description is necessary. 
            
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other. This is to give the author
            some choice at the minimum conformance level, and to provide additional requirements
            at higher levels. At Level A in Success Criterion 1.2.3, authors do have the choice
            of providing either an audio description or a full text alternative. If they wish
            to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio
            description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3,
            otherwise an additional requirement. At Level AAA under Success Criterion 1.2.8 they
            must provide an extended text description. This is an additional requirement if both
            1.2.3 and 1.2.5 were met by providing an audio description only. If 1.2.3 was met,
            however, by providing a text description, and the 1.2.5 requirement for an audio description
            was met, then 1.2.8 does not add new requirements.
         </p>

         <p>In the context of audio descriptions, <a>synchronized media</a> predominantly describes audio and video technologies that are combined and played in tandem, which allows an author to align the timing of the audio descriptions in the audio track with the appearance of the relevant visuals in the video. In pre-recorded content, there can be intentionally asynchronous sound or images; however, they will always occur at the same time on each playback of synchronized media.</p>
