   <h1>Understanding Sensory Characteristics</h1>

      <h2>Intent of Sensory Characteristics</h2>
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access instructions
         for using the content, even when they cannot perceive shape or size or use information
         about spatial location or orientation. 
         Some content relies on knowledge of the shape or position of objects that are not
         available from the structure of the content (for example, "round button" or "button
         to the right"). 
         Some users with disabilities are not able to perceive shape or position due to the
         nature of the assistive technologies they use. 
         This Success Criterion requires that additional information be provided to clarify
         instructions that are dependent on this kind of information.         
      </p>
      
      <p>Providing information using shape and/or location, however, is an effective method
         for many users including those with cognitive limitations.
         This provision should not discourage those types of cues as long as the information
         is also provided in other ways.
      </p>
      
      <p>In some languages, it is commonly understood that "above" refers to the content previous
         to that point in the content and "below" refers to the content after that point. In
         such languages, if the content being referenced is in the appropriate place in the
         reading order and the references are unambiguous, statements such as "choose one of
         the links below" or "all of the above" would conform to this Success Criterion. 
      </p>
      
      <p>WCAG was designed to apply only to controls that were displayed on a web page. The
         intent was to avoid describing controls solely via references to visual or auditory
         cues. When applying this to instructions for operating physical hardware controls
         (e.g. a web kiosk with dedicated content), tactile cues on the hardware might be described
         (e.g. the arrow shaped key, the round key on the right side). This success criterion
         is not intended to prevent the use of tactile cues in instructions.
      </p>

         <li>People who are blind and people who have low vision may not be able to understand
            instructions if they rely only on a description of the shape and/or location of content.
            Providing additional information in any instructions other than shape and/or location
            will allow users to understand the instructions even if they cannot perceive shape
            and/or location.

                  Example 1: Instructions for interpreting a schedule of competitive events references
                  colored icons in different shapes to indicate the venue for each event

            <p>
                  A table presents a list of times across the top row and a list of events in the first
                  vertical column and instructions are provided under the table: "Events marked with a
                  blue diamond are played on field A and events marked with a green circle are played
                  on field B." The instructions rely on color and shape only and result in a failure of
                  this criterion.

               <strong>
                  Example 2: An online multi-page survey 
                  
               </strong>

            <p>
               An online multi-page survey uses a link implemented as a green arrow icon placed
               in the lower right hand corner of the content to move from one survey page to the
               next. The arrow is clearly labeled with "Next" and the instructions state, "To move
               to the next section of the survey, select the green arrow icon labeled 'Next' in the
               lower right corner below the last survey question." 
               The instruction uses positioning and color to help identify the icon; 
               the instruction does not rely on these sensory characteristics since it also refers to the label, so it passes this criterion.
