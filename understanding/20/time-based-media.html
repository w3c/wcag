      <h2>Intent of Time-Based Media</h2>
      
      
      <p>The purpose of this guideline is to provide access to time-based and synchronized
         media.This includes media that is:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>audio-only</li>
         
         <li>video-only </li>
         
         <li>audio-video </li>
         
         <li>audio and/or video combined with interaction </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>To make it easy for authors to quickly determine which success criteria apply to their
         content, the type of media each success criterion applies to is included in its short
         name. 
      </p>
      
      <p>For 
         <strong>audio-only</strong> or 
         <strong>video-only</strong> media, you only need to apply the success criteria that say "
         <strong>audio-only</strong>" or "
         <strong>video-only</strong>" in their short name. If your media is not 
         <strong>audio-only</strong> or 
         <strong>video-only</strong>, then all the rest of the success criteria apply.
      </p>
      
      <p>Media can also be 
         <strong>live</strong> or 
         <strong>prerecorded</strong>. Each of the success criterion short names clearly tells you if the success criterion
         applies to 
         <strong>live</strong> or 
         <strong>prerecorded</strong> media. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
         Synchronized media is defined in the glossary as:
      </p>
      
      <p id="copysynchronizedmediadef"></p>
      
      <p>Note that an audio file accompanied by interaction is covered here, as is a video-only
         file that involves interaction. These are covered because interaction must take place
         at a particular time. Having a text transcript that said, "for more information, click
         now," would not be very helpful since the reader would have no idea when the audio
         said, "now." As a result, synchronized captions would be needed.
      </p>
      
      <p>Sometimes, there is so much dialogue that audio description cannot fit into existing
         pauses in the dialogue. The option at Level A to provide an alternative for time-based
         media instead of audio description for synchronized media would allow access to all
         of the information in the synchronized media. This option also allows access to the
         visual information in non-visual form when audio description is not provided for some
         other reason. 
      </p>
      
      <p>For synchronized media that includes interaction, interactive elements (for example
         links) could be embedded in the alternative for time-based media. 
      </p>
      
      <p>This guideline also includes (at Level AAA) sign language interpretation for synchronized
         media as well as an approach called extended audio description. In extended audio
         description, the video is frozen periodically to allow more audio description to take
         place than is possible in the existing pauses in the dialogue. This is a case where
         higher-level Success Criteria build upon the requirements of lower-level Success Criterion
         with the intention of having cumulative, progressively stronger, requirements.
