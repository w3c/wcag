      <h2>Intent of Contrast (Minimum)</h2>
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and its background, so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision or impaired contrast perception, without the use of contrast-enhancing assistive technology.
      </p>
      <p>For all consumers of visual content, adequate light-dark contrast is needed between the relative luminance of text and its background for good readability.
         Many different visual impairments can substantially impact contrast sensitivity, requiring more light-dark contrast, regardless of color (hue).
         For people who are not able to distinguish certain shades of color (often referred to as <q>color blindness</q>) hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading performance.
         Further, the inability to distinguish certain shades of color does not negatively affect light-dark contrast perception.
         Therefore, in the recommendation, contrast is calculated in such a way that color (hue) is not a key factor.
      </p>
      
      <p>Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random
         words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted
         without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this
         criterion. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast.
         The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to
         use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of
         pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large
         enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the
         Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large
         Print under 
         <a href="#resources">Resources</a>). "18 point" and "bold" can both have different meanings in
         different fonts but, except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there
         are so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding thin or unusual
         fonts is included in the definition for <a>large-scale</a> text.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         <p>When evaluating this Success Criterion, the font size in points should be obtained
            from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way that user agents do.
            Point sizes are based on the CSS <code>pt</code> size as defined in 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#reference-pixel">CSS3 Values</a>. The ratio between
            sizes in points and CSS pixels is <code>1pt = 1.333px</code>, therefore <code>14pt</code>
            and <code>18pt</code> are equivalent to approximately <code>18.5px</code> and <code>24px</code>.
         </p>
         <p>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities
            (e.g., <code>72ppi</code> or <code>96ppi</code>), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an
            image editing application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size.
            When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the
            resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the
            default size for body text. For example, for a <code>72ppi</code> image, an author would need
            to use approximately 19pt and 24pt font sizes in order to successfully present images
            of large-scale text to a user. 
         </p>
         <p>The 3:1 and 4.5:1 contrast ratios referenced in this Success Criterion are intended to be
            treated as threshold values. When comparing the computed contrast ratio to the Success Criterion
            ratio, the computed values should not be rounded (e.g., 4.499:1 would not meet the 4.5:1 threshold).</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="note">
         <p>Because authors do not have control over user settings for font smoothing/anti-aliasing, when evaluating this
            Success Criterion, refer to the foreground and background colors obtained from the user agent, or the underlying
            markup and stylesheets, rather than the text as presented on screen.</p>
         <p>Due to anti-aliasing, particularly thin or unusual fonts may be rendered by user agents with a much fainter
            color than the actual text color defined in the underlying CSS. This can lead to situations where text has
            a contrast ratio that nominally passes the Success Criterion, but has a much lower contrast in practice.
            In these cases, best practice would be for authors to choose a font with stronger/thicker lines,
            or to aim for a foreground/background color combination that exceeds the normative requirements
            of this Success Criterion.
         </p>
      </div>

      <p>The contrast requirements for text also apply to images of text
         (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) - see
         <a href="images-of-text">Success Criterion 1.4.5: Images of Text</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be
         understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include
         a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be
         invisible to all viewers. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated
         in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content
         in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are
         not included in the exception.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>In this provision there is an exception that reads "that are part of a picture that
         contains significant other visual content,". This exception is intended to separate
         pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text
         in order to get a particular look. 
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate. It is also
            harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images
            of text, which is necessary for some users. Therefore, we suggest using text wherever
            possible, and when not, consider supplying an image of higher resolution.
            
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <p>This Success Criterion applies to text in the page, including
         placeholder text and text that is shown when a pointer is hovering over an object
         or when an object has keyboard focus. If any of these are used in a page, the text
         needs to provide sufficient contrast.
      </p>
      
      <p>Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for content presented
         in charts, graphs, diagrams, and other non-text-based information, which is covered by
         <a href="non-text-contrast">Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast</a>.

         <h3>Rationale for the Ratios Chosen</h3>
         
         <p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]]
            for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in this Success Criterion to account
            for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity, congenital
            or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that typically
            accompanies aging.
         </p>
         
         <p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable
            contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding
            that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity
            loss of roughly 1.5 [[ARDITI-FAYE]]. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast ratio of
            <code>3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1</code>. Following analogous empirical findings and the same logic,
            the user with 20/80 visual acuity would require contrast of about 7:1. This ratio is used in
            Success Criterion 1.4.6.
         </p>

         <p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital
            and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than
            for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are
            different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing
            effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not
            feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast
            that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution
            is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses.
            The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without
            regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength
            colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia.
            (We provide an advisory technique on avoiding red on black for that reason). For more
            information see [[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994]] 
            [[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1996]] 
            [[ARDITI]].

         <div class="note">
            
            <p>Some people with cognitive disabilities require color combinations or hues that have
               low contrast, and therefore we allow and encourage authors to provide mechanisms to
               adjust the foreground and background colors of the content. Some of the combinations
               that could be chosen may have contrast levels that will be lower than those those
               specified here. This is not a violation of this Success Criterion, provided
               there is a mechanism that will return to the required values set out here.
            </p>          
            
         </div>
         
         <p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the
            loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent
            to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is
            commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. [[GITTINGS-FOZARD]] 
         </p>
         
         <p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the
            loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent
            to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually
            use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies
            usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them).
            The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity
            experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides
            contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.

         <p>Conversion from nonlinear to linear RGB values is based on IEC/4WD 61966-2-1 [[IEC-4WD]].</p>
         
         <p>The formula (<code>L1/L2</code>) for contrast is based on [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]] standards.</p>
         
         <p>The ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard calls for the contribution from ambient light to be
            included in the calculation of L1 and L2. The <code>.05</code> value used is based on Typical Viewing
            Flare from [[IEC-4WD]].
         </p>
         
         <p>This Success Criterion and its definitions use the terms "contrast ratio" and "relative
            luminance" rather than "luminance" to reflect the fact that Web content does not emit
            light itself. The contrast ratio gives a measure of the relative luminance that would
            result when displayed. (Because it is a ratio, it is dimensionless.)

      <ul>
         
         <li>People with low vision often have difficulty reading text that does not contrast with
            its background. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency
            that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a minimum luminance contrast ratio
            between the text and its background can make the text more readable even if the person
            does not see the full range of colors. It also works for the rare individuals who
            see no color.
