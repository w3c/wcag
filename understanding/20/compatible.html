      <h2>Intent of Compatible</h2>
      
      
      <p>The purpose of this guideline is to support compatibility with current and future
         user agents, 
         <em>especially</em> assistive technologies (AT). This is done both by 1) ensuring that authors do not
         do things that would break AT (e.g., poorly formed markup) or circumvent AT (e.g.,
         by using unconventional markup or code) and 2) exposing information in the content
         in standard ways that assistive technologies can recognize and interact with. Since
         technologies change quickly, and AT developers have much trouble keeping up with rapidly
         changing technologies, it is important that content follow conventions and be compatible
         with APIs so that AT can more easily work with new technologies as they evolve.

            when the technology is turned off or not supported.
