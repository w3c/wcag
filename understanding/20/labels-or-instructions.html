      <h2>Intent of Labels or Instructions</h2>
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to have content authors present instructions
         or labels that identify the controls in a form so that users know what input data
         is expected. In the case of radio buttons, checkboxes, comboboxes, or similar controls
         that provide users with options, each option must have an appropriate label so that
         users know what they are actually selecting. 
         Instructions or labels may also specify data formats for data entry fields, especially
         if they are out of the customary formats or if there are specific rules for correct
         input. Content authors may also choose to make such instructions available to users
         only when the individual control has focus especially when instructions are long and
         verbose.
      </p>
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is not to clutter the page with unnecessary information
         but to provide important cues and instructions that will benefit people with disabilities.
         Too much information or instruction can be just as harmful as too little.
         The goal is to make certain that enough information is provided for the user to accomplish
         the task without undue confusion or navigation.
      </p>
         
      <p>This Success Criterion does not require that labels or instructions be correctly marked up, 
         identified, or associated with their respective controls - this aspect is covered separately by
         <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1: Info and Relationships</a>. It is possible for content
         to pass this Success Criterion (providing relevant labels and instructions) while failing
         Success Criterion 1.3.1 (if the labels or instructions aren't correctly marked up, identified, or associated).
      </p>
      <p>Further, this Success Criterion does not take into consideration whether or not alternative methods of
         providing an accessible name or description for form controls and inputs has been used - this aspect is
         covered separately by <a href="name-role-value">4.1.2: Name, Role and Value</a>. It is possible
         for controls and inputs to have an appropriate accessible name or description (e.g. using <code>aria-label="..."</code>)
         and therefore pass Success Criterion 4.1.2, but to still fail this Success Criterion (if the labels or instructions
         aren't presented to all users, not just those using assistive technologies).
      </p>
      <p>This Success Criterion does not apply to links or other controls (such as an expand/collapse widget, or similar
         interactive components) that are not associated with data entry.
      </p>
      <p>While this Success Criterion requires that controls and inputs have labels or instructions, whether or
         not labels (if used) are sufficiently clear or descriptive is covered separately by
         <a href="headings-and-labels">2.4.6: Headings and Labels</a>.

      <h2>Benefits of Labels or Instructions</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Providing labels and instructions (including examples of expected
            data formats) helps all users - but particularly those with cognitive, language, and learning
            disabilities - to enter information correctly.
         </li>
         
         <li>Providing labels and instructions (including identification of required
            fields) can prevent users from making incomplete or incorrect form submissions, which prevents
            users from having to navigate once more through a page/form in order to fix submission errors.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
   </section>
   
   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Labels or Instructions</h2>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>A field which requires the user to enter the two character abbreviation for a US state
            has a link next to it which will popup an alphabetized list of state names and the
            correct abbreviation.
         </li>
         
         <li>A field for entering a date has text instructions to indicate the correct format
            for the date.
         </li>
         
         <li>To enter their name, users are provided with two separate text fields. Rather than
            having a single label "Name" (which would appear to leave the second text field unlabelled),
            each field is given an explicit label - "Given Name" and "Family Name".
         </li>
         
         <li>A U.S. phone number separates the area code, exchange, and number into three fields.
            Parentheses surround the area code field, and a dash separates the exchange and number
            fields. While the punctuation provides visual clues to those familiar with the U.S.
            telephone number format, the punctuation is not sufficient to label the fields. The
            single "Phone number" label also cannot label all three fields. To address this, the
            three fields are grouped in a fieldset with the legend "Phone number". Visual labels for
            the fields (beyond the punctuation) cannot be provided
            in the design, so invisible labels are provided with the "title" attribute to each
            of the three fields. The value of this attribute for the three fields are, respectively,
            "Area Code", "Exchange", and "Number". 
         </li>
