      <h2>Intent of Labels or Instructions</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to have content authors place instructions
         or labels that identify the controls in a form so that users know what input data
         is expected. Instructions or labels may also specify data formats for fields especially
         if they are out of the customary formats or if there are specific rules for correct
         input. Content authors may also choose to make such instructions available to users
         only when the individual control has focus especially when instructions are long and
         verbose.
      </p>
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is not to clutter the page with unnecessary information
         but to provide important cues and instructions that will benefit people with disabilities.
         Too much information or instruction can be just as much of a hindrance as too little.
         The goal is to make certain that enough information is provided for the user to accomplish
         the task without undue confusion or navigation.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>When labels are provided for input objects, the input object's relationship to the
            label (or to redundant text serving as the label) must be programmatically determinable
            or available in text per 
            <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1: Info and Relationships</a>.
         </p>

         <h3>Benefits of Labels or Instructions</h3>
         
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>When label elements are associated with input elements the label is spoken by screen
               readers when the field receives focus and users with impaired motor control are helped
               by a larger clickable area for the control, since clicking on the label or the control
               will activate the control.
            </li>
            
            <li>Field labels located in close proximity to the associated field assist users of screen
               magnifiers because the field and label are more likely to visible within the magnified
               area of the page.
            </li>
            
            <li>Providing examples of expected data formats help users with cognitive, language and
               learning disabilities to enter information correctly.
            </li>
            
            <li>Clearly identifying required fields prevents a keyboard only user from submitting
               an incomplete form and having to navigate the redisplayed form to find the uncompleted
               field and provide the missing information.
            </li>

      <h2>Examples of Labels or Instructions</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>A field which requires the user to enter the two character abbreviation for a US state
            has a link next to it which will popup an alphabetized list of state names and the
            correct abbreviation.
         </li>
         
         <li>A field for entering a date contains initial text which indicates the correct format
            for the date.
         </li>
         
         <li>A field for entering a given name is clearly labeled with "Given Name" and the field
            for family name is labeled "Family Name" to avoid confusion over which name is requested.
         </li>
         
         <li>A U.S. phone number separates the area code, exchange, and number into three fields.
            Parentheses surround the area code field, and a dash separates the exchange and number
            fields. While the punctuation provides visual clues to those familiar with the U.S.
            telephone number format, the punctuation is not sufficient to label the fields. The
            single "Phone number" label also cannot label all three fields. To address this, the
            three fields are grouped in a fieldset with the legend "Phone number". Visual labels for the fields (beyond the punctuation) cannot be provided
            in the design, so invisible labels are provided with the "title" attribute to each
            of the three fields. The value of this attribute for the three fields are, respectively,
            "Area Code", "Exchange", and "Number".
