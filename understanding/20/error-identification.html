      <h2>Intent of Error Identification</h2>

      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that users are aware that an error
         has occurred and can determine what is wrong. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission,
         it is not sufficient to only re-display the form without providing any hint that the submission
         failed.
         The error must be indicated in <a>text</a>.
         Whether or not an error message provides users with sufficient information about the nature of
         the error, and what they should do to correct it, is covered more specifically by
         <a href="error-suggestion">3.3.3 Error Suggestion</a>.
      </p>
      <p>An "input error" is information provided by the user that is not accepted. This includes:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>information that is required by the web page but omitted by the user, or</li>
         <li>information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or allowed values.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>the user fails to enter the proper abbreviation in a state, province, or region field;</li>
         <li>the user enters a state abbreviation that is not a valid state; </li>
         <li>the user enters a non existent zip or postal code;</li>
         <li>the user enters a birth date 2 years in the future;</li>
         <li>the user enters alphabetic characters or parentheses into their phone number field that only accepts numbers;</li>
         <li>the user enters a bid that is below the previous bid or the minimum bid increment.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
         <p>If a user enters a value that is too high or too low, and the coding on the page automatically
            changes that value to fall within the allowed range, the user's error would still
            need to be described to them as required by the success criterion. Such an error description
            telling the person of the changed value would meet both this success criterion (Error
            Identification) and <a href="error-suggestion">3.3.3 Error Suggestion</a>.
         </p>
      </div>

      <p>The identification and description of an error can be combined with programmatic information
         that user agents or assistive technologies can use to identify an error and provide
         error information to the user. For example, certain technologies can specify that
         the user's input must not fall outside a specific range, or that a form field is required.
         Currently, few technologies support this kind of programmatic information, but this
         success criterion does not require, nor prevent it.</p>

      <p>It is perfectly acceptable to indicate the error in other ways such as through the use of an image,
         color, or other visual indicator, in addition to the text description.</p>

      <div class="note">
         <p>This criterion does not mandate any particular way in which errors should be displayed. Depending
            on the situation, it may be more suitable for all errors to be listed at the start or before a form.
            In other cases, it may be more appropriate to show errors inline, with error messages next to the specific
            fields that are in error. Errors could also be listed in an alert, or dialog. This criterion does not
            cover which of these methods should be used - the only requirement is for errors  to be presented to users in text or a text alternative.
         </p>

      <h2>Benefits of Error Identification</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>
            Providing information about input errors in text allows users who are blind or color deficient (color blind) to perceive the fact that an error occurred.
         </li>
         <li>
            This success criterion may help people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities
            who have difficulty understanding the specific reason why a form submission failed (in cases
            where this is not already made obvious by the nature of the form).
         </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples of Error Identification</h2>

      <dl>
         <dt>Identifying errors in a form submission</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>An airline Web site offers a special promotion on discounted flights. The user is
               asked to complete a simple form that asks for personal information such as name, address,
               phone number, seating preference and e-mail address. If any of the fields of the form
               are either not completed or completed incorrectly, an alert is displayed notifying
               the user which field or fields were missing or incorrect.</p>

            <div class="note">
               <p>This success criterion does not mean that color or text styles cannot be used to indicate
                  errors. It simply requires that errors also be identified using text.
               </p>
            </div>
         </dd>
         <dt>Providing multiple cues</dt>
         <dd>The user fails to fill in two fields on the form.  In addition to describing the error
               and providing a unique character to make it easy to search for the fields, the fields
               are highlighted in yellow to make it easier to visually search for them as well.</dd>
