   <h1>Understanding Error Identification</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Error Identification</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users are aware that an error
         has occurred and can determine what is wrong. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission,
         it is not sufficient to only re-display the form without providing any hint that the submission
         failed. It also won't be sufficient to merely indicate that fields are in error, but not providing
         users with sufficient information about the specific nature of the error. The error messages should
         be as specific as possible. And, to ensure that the information is available to all users (whether
         they are using assistive technologies or not), the error messages must be provided as visible text.
      </p>
      <p>Per the definition in WCAG 2.0, an "input error" is information provided by the user
         that is not accepted. This includes: 
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>information that is required by the web page but omitted by the user, or</li>
         
         <li>information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data
            format or allowed values.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>For example:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>the user fails to enter the proper abbreviation in to state, province, region, etc.
            field; 
         </li>
         
         <li>the user enters a state abbreviation that is not a valid state; </li>
         
         <li>the user enters a non existent zip or postal code;</li>
         
         <li>the user enters a birth date 2 years in the future;</li>
         
         <li>the user enters alphabetic characters or parentheses into their phone number field
            that only accepts numbers;
         </li>
         
         <li>the user enters a bid that is below the previous bid or the minimum bid increment.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>If a user enters a value that is too high or too low, and the coding on the page automatically
            changes that value to fall within the allowed range, the user's error would still
            need to be described to them as required by the success criterion. Such an error description
            telling the person of the changed value would meet both this success criterion (Error
            Identification) and 
            <a href="error-suggestion" class="understanding">Success Criterion 3.3.3 (Error Suggestion)</a>. 
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <p>The identification and description of an error can be combined with programmatic information
         that user agents or assistive technologies can use to identify an error and provide
         error information to the user. For example, certain technologies can specify that
         the user's input must not fall outside a specific range, or that a form field is required.
         Currently, few technologies support this kind of programmatic information, but this
         Success Criterion does not require, nor prevent it.
      </p>
      
      <p>It is perfectly acceptable to indicate the error in other ways such as image, color
         etc, in addition to the text description.
      </p>
      <p>There may also be situations in which it is clear from the context what the specific error
         is - for instance, in a simple login form with a username and password field, if a user
         leaves one of the fields completely blank, simply indicating that the empty field is in
         error using an image or icon (with appropriate alternative text) would be sufficient.
         However, if the user did enter data in both of those fields, and login was unsuccessful, further
         information and an actual specific error message will be required (e.g. "no account found with this
         username", or "the username or password are incorrect"). Likewise, in a form that explicitly indicates
         that all fields are mandatory/required, it will be sufficient to indicate empty fields as being in error,
         without the need to reiterate that the user must fill in the field.

      <h2>Benefits of Error Identification</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Providing information about input errors in text allows all users to perceive the fact
            that an error occurred.
         </li>
         
         <li>
            This Success Criterion may help people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities
            who have difficulty understanding the specific reason why a form submission failed (in cases
            where this is not already made obvious by the nature of the form).

               An airline Web site offers a special promotion on discounted flights. The user is
               asked to complete a simple form that asks for personal information such as name, address,
               phone number, seating preference and e-mail address. If any of the fields of the form
               are either not completed or completed incorrectly, an alert is displayed notifying
               the user which field or fields were missing or incorrect.

               <p>This Success Criterion does not mean that color or text styles cannot be used to indicate
                  errors. It simply requires that errors also be identified using text.
