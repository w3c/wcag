      <h2>Intent of Three Flashes</h2>
      
      
      <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to further reduce the chance of seizures.
         Seizures cannot be completely eliminated since some people are so sensitive.  However,
         by eliminating all 3-per-second flashing over any area of the screen, the chances
         of a person having a seizure are further reduced than when just meeting the measures
         ordinarily used today in standards internationally, as we do at Level A. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Whereas 
         <a href="three-flashes-or-below-threshold" class="guideline">Success Criterion 2.3.1</a> allows flashing if it is dim enough or has a small enough area, Success Criterion
         2.3.2 does not allow flashing greater than 3 per second, regardless of brightness
         or size. As a result, even a single flashing pixel would violate this criterion. The
         intent is to guard against flashing larger than a single pixel, but since an unknown
         amount of magnification or high contrast setting may be applied, the prohibition is
         against any flashing. 
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>In some cases, what we refer to as "blinking" and what we refer to as "flashing" may
            overlap slightly.  We are using different terms for the two because "blinking" causes
            a distraction problem which you can allow for a short time as long as it stops (or
            can be stopped) whereas "flashing" is a seizure trigger and cannot be allowed or it
            will cause a seizure. The seizure would occur faster than most users could turn it
            off.  "Blink" therefore refers to slow repeating changes that would distract.  "Flash"
            refers to changes that could cause a seizure if they were bright enough or persisted
            long enough. Blinking usually doesn't occur at speeds of 3 per second or more so blink
            and flash do not overlap. However, blinking can occur faster than 3 per second so
            there could be an overlap. See 
            <a href="pause-stop-hide">2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide</a> for more information on blink.

         <li>Individuals who have seizures when viewing flashing material will be able to view
            all of the material on a site without having a seizure and without having to miss
            the full experience of the content by being limited to text alternatives. This includes
            people with photosensitive epilepsy as well as other photosensitive seizure disorders.
