      <h2>Intent of Language of Parts</h2>

      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that user agents can correctly present
         phrases, passages, and in some cases words written in multiple languages. This makes it possible for user agents and
         assistive technologies to present content according to the  presentation and pronunciation
         rules for that language. This applies to graphical browsers as well as screen readers,
         braille displays, and other voice browsers.
      </p>

      <p>Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately
         if the language of each passage of text is identified. Screen readers can use the
         pronunciation rules of the language of the text. Visual browsers can display characters
         and scripts in appropriate ways. This is especially important when switching between
         languages that read from left to right and languages that read from right to left,
         or when text is rendered in a language that uses a different alphabet. Users with
         disabilities who know all the languages used in the web page will be better able to
         understand the content when each passage is rendered appropriately.
      </p>

      <p>When no other language has been specified for a phrase or passage of text, its human
         language is the default human language of the web page (see <a href="language-of-page">Success Criterion 3.1.1</a>).
         So the human language of all content in single language documents can be programmatically
         determined.
      </p>

      <p>Individual words or phrases in one language can become part of another language. For
         example, "rendezvous" is a French word that has been adopted in English, appears in
         English dictionaries, and is properly pronounced by English screen readers. Hence
         a passage of English text may contain the word "rendezvous" without specifying that
         its human language is French and still satisfy this success criterion. Frequently,
         when the human language of text appears to be changing for a single word, that word
         has become part of the language of the surrounding text. Because this is so common
         in some languages, single words should be considered part of the language of the surrounding
         text unless it is clear that a change in language was intended. If there is doubt
         whether a change in language is intended, consider whether the word would be pronounced
         the same (except for accent or intonation) in the language of the immediately surrounding
         text.
      </p>

      <p>Most professions require frequent use of technical terms which may originate from
         a foreign language. Such terms are usually not translated to all languages. The universal
         nature of technical terms also facilitate communication between professionals.
      </p>

      <p>Some common examples of technical terms include: Homo sapiens, Alpha Centauri, hertz,
         and habeas corpus.
      </p>

      <p>Identifying changes in language is important for a number of reasons:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>It allows braille translation software to follow changes in language, e.g., substitute
            control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent
            erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.
         </li>
         <li>Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to speak the text
            in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation. If changes are not marked, the
            synthesizer will try its best to speak the words in the  default language it works
            in. Thus, the French word for car, "<span lang="fr">voiture</span>" would be pronounced "voyture" by a speech
            synthesizer that uses English as its default language.
         </li>
         <li>Marking changes in language can benefit future developments in technology, for example
            users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use
            machines to translate unfamiliar languages.
         </li>
         <li>Marking changes in language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using
            a dictionary.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples of Language of Parts</h2>

      <h3>A German phrase in an English sentence</h3>
      <p>In the sentence, "He maintained that the DDR (German Democratic Republic) was just a '<span lang="de">Treppenwitz der Weltgeschichte</span>'," the German phrase '<span lang="de">Treppenwitz der Weltgeschichte</span>' is marked as German. Depending on the markup language, English may either be marked as the language for the entire document except where specified, or marked at the paragraph level. When a screen reader encounters the German phrase, it changes pronunciation rules from English to German to pronounce the word correctly.</p>

      <h3>Alternative language links</h3>
      <p>An HTML web page includes links to versions of the page in other languages (e.g.,
         <span lang="de">Deutsch</span>, <span lang="fr">Français</span>, <span lang="nl">Nederlands</span>, <span lang="ca">Catalan</span>, etc.). The text of each link is the name of the language, in that language. The language of each link is indicated via a <code>lang</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="..." lang="de"&gt;Deutsch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="..." lang="it"&gt;Italiano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="..." lang="fr"&gt;Français&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  ...
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="..." lang="zh-hant"&gt;繁體中文&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
     
      <h3>Element content used as accessible name</h3>
      <p>When content is used as the accessible name of an element, the correct language should be specified on that element. This helps assistive technologies pronounce it accurately.</p>
      <p>The following link may be pronounced in English, mispronouncing "<span lang="es">Español</span>".</p>
      <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;a href="/es/"&gt;&lt;span lang="es"&gt;Español&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>The following version correctly applies the Spanish language to the element, ensuring that "<span lang="es">Español</span>" can be correctly pronounced in Spanish.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;a href="/es/" lang="es"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Español&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Although marking only the <code>span</code> with a different language (as in the first example) is theoretically correct, user agents and assistive technologies may present the element to the user using the inherited English language, which can result in mispronunciation of "<span lang="es">Español</span>". 
           Since the <code>span</code> is the sole content of the link and contributes entirely to its accessible name, setting the language on the parent 
           <code>a</code> element (as in the second example) is more reliable and ensures that screen readers pronounce the content correctly.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Element content in multiple languages used as accessible name</h3>
      <p>When content includes multiple languages, any child elements that use a different language must have their own <code>lang</code> attribute.</p>
      <p>This example assumes the page's default language is English. The main text of the link is in English, but it includes the original Italian title of a poem. The Italian portion is correctly marked with <code>lang="it"</code>.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;a href="/la-divina-commedia.html"&gt;Read this book: &lt;span lang="it"&gt;La Divina Commedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
      <div class="note">
          <p>Since the accessible name of this link consists in multiple languages, it is required to mark each portion with the appropriate <code>lang</code>, either inherited or set explicitly. That said, if assistive technologies present the content using only the inherited language (and mispronounce some parts), this does not constitute an accessibility violation.</p>
      </div>

         <h3>"Podcast" used in a French sentence</h3>
         <p>Because "podcast" is part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text in the following excerpt, "<span lang="fr">À l'occasion de l'exposition "Energie éternelle. 1500 ans d'art indien", le Palais des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles a lancé son premier podcast. Vous pouvez télécharger ce podcast au format M4A et MP3</span>", no indication of language change is required.</p>

         <h3>The element's content and attribute values are in different languages</h3>

         <p>The following example assumes that the page's default content is in English. The link's <code class="language-html">title</code> attribute is in English, but the nested <code class="language-html">span</code> element that contains the words "<span lang="it">La Divina Commedia</span>" has a <code>lang="it"</code> attribute.</p>

         <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;a title="Opens in a new tab" href="/la-divina-commedia.html" target="_blank"&gt;Read this book: &lt;span lang="it"&gt;La Divina Commedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
