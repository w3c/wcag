      <h2>Intent of Language of Parts</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents can correctly present
          phrases, passages, and in some cases words written in multiple languages. This makes it possible for user agents and
         assistive technologies to present content according to the  presentation and pronunciation
         rules for that language. This applies to graphical browsers as well as screen readers,
         braille displays, and other voice browsers.
      </p>
      
      <p>Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately
         if the language of each passage of text is identified. Screen readers can use the
         pronunciation rules of the language of the text. Visual browsers can display characters
         and scripts in appropriate ways. This is especially important when switching between
         languages that read from left to right and languages that read from right to left,
         or when text is rendered in a language that uses a different alphabet. Users with
         disabilities who know all the languages used in the Web page will be better able to
         understand the content when each passage is rendered appropriately. 
      </p>
      
      <p>When no other language has been specified for a phrase or passage of text, its human
         language is the default human language of the Web page (see <a href="language-of-page">Success Criterion 3.1.1</a>).
         So the human language of all content in single language documents can be programmatically
         determined.
      </p>
      
      <p>Individual words or phrases in one language can become part of another language. For
         example, "rendezvous" is a French word that has been adopted in English, appears in
         English dictionaries, and is properly pronounced by English screen readers. Hence
         a passage of English text may contain the word "rendezvous" without specifying that
         its human language is French and still satisfy this Success Criterion. Frequently,
         when the human language of text appears to be changing for a single word, that word
         has become part of the language of the surrounding text. Because this is so common
         in some languages, single words should be considered part of the language of the surrounding
         text unless it is clear that a change in language was intended. If there is doubt
         whether a change in language is intended, consider whether the word would be pronounced
         the same (except for accent or intonation) in the language of the immediately surrounding
         text.
      </p>
      
      <p>Most professions require frequent use of technical terms which may originate from
         a foreign language. Such terms are usually not translated to all languages. The universal
         nature of technical terms also facilitate communication between professionals.
      </p>
      
      <p>Some common examples of technical terms include: Homo sapiens, Alpha Centauri, hertz,
         and habeas corpus.
      </p>
      
      <p>Identifying changes in language is important for a number of reasons:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>It allows braille translation software to follow changes in language, e.g., substitute
            control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent
            erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.
         </li>
         
         <li>Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to speak the text
            in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation. If changes are not marked, the
            synthesizer will try its best to speak the words in the  default language it works
            in. Thus, the French word for car, "<span lang="fr">voiture</span>" would be pronounced "voyture" by a speech
            synthesizer that uses English as its default language. 
         </li>
         
         <li>Marking changes in language can benefit future developments in technology, for example
            users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use
            machines to translate unfamiliar languages.  
         </li>
         
         <li>Marking changes in language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using
            a dictionary. 
         </li>

      <h2>Benefits of Language of Parts</h2>
      
      <p>This Success Criterion helps:</p>
      
      <ul>
         <li>people who use screen readers or other technologies that convert text into synthetic
            speech;
         </li>
         
         <li>people who find it difficult to read written material with fluency and accuracy, such
            as recognizing characters and alphabets, decoding words, and understanding words and
            phrases;
         </li>
         
         <li>people with certain cognitive, language and learning disabilities who use text-to-speech
            software;
            
         </li>
         
         <li>people who rely on captions to recognize language changes in the soundtrack of synchronized
            media content.

               <strong>A German phrase in an English sentence.</strong>							     
            </p>
            <p>In the sentence, "He maintained that the DDR (German Democratic Republic) was just
               a '<span lang="de">Treppenwitz der Weltgeschichte</span>'," the German phrase '<span lang="de">Treppenwitz der Weltgeschichte</span>' is marked as German. Depending on the markup language, English may either be marked
               as the language for the entire document except where specified, or marked at the paragraph
               level. When a screen reader encounters the German phrase, it changes pronunciation
               rules from English to German to pronounce the word correctly.
            </p>

               <strong>Alternative language links</strong>							     
            </p>
            <p>An HTML Web page includes links to versions of the page in other languages (e.g.,
               <span lang="de">Deutsch</span>, <span lang="fr">Français</span>, <span lang="nl">Nederlands</span>, <span lang="ca">Catalan</span>, etc.). The text of each link is the name of the language, in that language. The language of each link is indicated via a <code class="att">lang</code> attribute.
            </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="..." lang="de"&gt;Deutsch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

            </p>
            <p>Because "podcast" is part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text in
               the following excerpt, "<span lang="fr">À l'occasion de l'exposition "Energie éternelle. 1500 ans d'art indien", le Palais des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles a lancé son premier podcast. Vous pouvez télécharger ce podcast au format M4A et MP3</span>", no indication of language change is required.
