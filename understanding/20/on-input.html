      <h2>Intent of On Input</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that entering data or selecting
         a form control has predictable effects. Changing the setting of any user interface
         component is changing some aspect in the control that will persist when the user is
         no longer interacting with it. So checking a checkbox, entering text into a text field,
         or changing the selected option in a list control changes its setting, but activating
         a link or a button does not. Changes in context can confuse users who do not easily
         perceive the change or are easily distracted by changes. Changes of context are appropriate
         only when it is clear that such a change will happen in response to the user's action.
         
         
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>This Success Criterion covers changes in context due to changing the setting of a
            control. Clicking on links or tabs in a tab control is activating the control, not
            changing the setting of that control.

         <p>What is meant by "component" and "user interface component" here is also sometimes

         <ul>
            
            <li>This Success Criterion helps users with disabilities by making interactive content
               more predictable. Unexpected changes of context can be so disorienting for users with
               visual disabilities or cognitive limitations that they are unable to use the content.

            <li>
               
               <p>Individuals who are unable to detect changes of context are less likely to become
                  disoriented while navigating a site. For example:
                  
               </p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>Individuals who are blind or have low vision may have difficulty knowing when a visual
                     context change has occurred, such as a new window popping up. In this case, warning
                     users of context changes in advance minimizes confusion when the user discovers that
                     the back button no longer behaves as expected. 
                     
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
            </li>
            
            <li>Some individuals with low vision, with reading and intellectual disabilities, and
               others who have difficulty interpreting visual cues may benefit from additional cues
               in order to detect changes of context.

      <h2>Examples of On Input</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            A form is provided for creating calendar entries in a Web based calendaring and scheduling
            application. Along with the standard fields for subject, time and location, there
            is a set of radio buttons to select the type of calendar entry to create.  The calendar
            entry type can be meeting, appointment or reminder.  If the user selects the radio
            for meeting, additional fields are displayed on the page for entering the meeting
            participants. Different fields appear if the reminder button is chosen. Because only
            parts of the entry change and the overall structure remains the same the basic context
            remains for the user.  
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            A form contains fields representing US phone numbers. All of the numbers have a three
            digit area code followed by a three digit prefix and finally a four digit number,
            and each part of the phone number is entered into a separate field. When the user
            completes the entry of one field the focus automatically moves to the next field of
            the phone number. This behavior of phone fields is described for the user at the beginning
            of the form.
