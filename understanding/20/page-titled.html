      <h2>Intent of Page Titled</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to help users find content and orient themselves
         within it by ensuring that each web page has a descriptive title. Titles identify
         the current location without requiring users to read or interpret page content. When
         titles appear in site maps or lists of search results, users can more quickly identify
         the content they need. User agents make the title of the page easily available to
         the user for identifying the page. For instance, a user agent may display the page
         title in the  window title bar or as the name of the tab containing the page.
      </p>
      
      <p>In cases where the page is a document or a web application, the name of the document
         or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page. Note that
         it is not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things
         may also describe the purpose or the topic of the page. 
      </p>

      <p>In cases such as Single Page Applications (SPAs), where various distinct pages/views are
         all nominally served from the same URI and the content of the page is changed dynamically,
         the title of the page should also be changed dynamically to reflect the content or topic of
         the current view.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <a href="link-purpose-in-context" class="understanding">Success Criteria 2.4.4</a> and 
         <a href="link-purpose-link-only" class="understanding">2.4.9</a> deal with the purpose of links, many of which are links to web pages. Here also,
         the name of a document or web application being linked to would be sufficient to describe
         the purpose of the link. Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar,
         is good practice and provides continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web
         page that the user lands on.

      <h2>Benefits of Page Titled</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            This criterion benefits all users in allowing users to quickly and easily identify
            whether the information contained in the web page is relevant to their needs. 
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            People with visual disabilities will benefit from being able to differentiate content
            when multiple web pages are open. 
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            People with cognitive disabilities, limited short-term memory and reading disabilities
            also benefit from the ability to identify content by its title. 
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            This criterion also benefits people with severe mobility impairments whose mode of
            operation relies on audio when navigating between web pages.

      <dl>
         <dt>An HTML web page</dt>
         <dd>The descriptive title of an HTML web page is marked up with the &lt;title&gt; element so

                  <li>
                    Specific patterns are pages titled "X Pattern | APG | WAI | W3C" (e.g., "Alert and Message Dialogs Pattern | APG | WAI | W3C")

         <dt>A web application</dt>
         <dd>A banking application lets users inspect their bank accounts, view past statements,
               and perform transactions. The web application dynamically generates titles for each
               web page, e.g., "Bank XYZ, accounts for Alex Smith" "Bank XYZ, December 2005 statement
               for Account 1234-5678".</dd>
