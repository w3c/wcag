      <h2>Intent of Link Purpose (In Context)</h2>
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each
         link so they can decide whether they want to follow the link.</p>
      <p>Whenever possible, provide link text that identifies the purpose of the link without
         needing additional context – this approach satisfies the <q>purpose of each link can be
         determined from the link text alone</q> aspect of this Criterion, and will benefit
         all users, whether they use assistive technologies or not. Assistive technologies
         can provide users with a list of links that are on the web page. Link text that is as
         meaningful as possible will aid users who want to choose from this list of links.
         Meaningful link text also helps those who wish to tab from link to link.</p>
      <p>The second aspect of this Criterion, <q>link text together with its <a>programmatically
         determined link context</a></q>, primarily benefits assistive technology users.
         If it's not possible to provide link text that, in isolation, conveys the purpose of the link,
         authors will need to make sure that there is at least additional <em>context</em> for the link.
         Assistive technologies can provide users with easy access to the link context, provided that
         it is programmatically determinable. This can give users additional information that will help
         them determine the purpose of a link.</p>
      <p>The text of, or associated with, the link is intended to describe the purpose of the
         link. In cases where the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name
         of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of
         the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is
         not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things may
         also describe the purpose of the link.</p>
      <p><a href="page-titled" class="understanding">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> deals with the titles of pages. Here
         also, the name of a document or web application
         being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.
         Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides
         continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on.</p>
      <p>In some situations, authors may want to provide part of the description of the link
         in logically related text that provides the context for the link. In this case the
         user should be able to identify the purpose of the link without moving focus from
         the link. In other words, they can arrive on a link and find out more about it without
         losing their place. This can be achieved by putting the description of the link in
         the same sentence, paragraph, list item, or table cell as the link, or in the table header cell for a link in a
         data table, because these are directly associated with the link itself. Alternatively, authors may choose to
         use an ARIA technique to associate additional text on the page with the link.</p>
      <p>This context will be most usable if it precedes the link. (For instance, if you must
         use ambiguous link text, it is better to put it at the end of the sentence that describes
         its destination, rather than putting the ambiguous phrase at the beginning of the
         sentence.) If the description follows the link, there can be confusion and difficulty
         for screen reader users who are reading through the page in order (top to bottom).</p>
      <p>It is a best practice for links with the same destination to have consistent text
         (and this is a requirement per
         <a href="consistent-identification" class="guideline">Success Criterion 3.2.4</a> for pages in a set). It is
         also a best practice for links with different purposes
         and destinations to have different link text.</p>
      <p>A best practice for links to <a>conforming alternate versions</a> is to ensure that the link text to the
         conforming alternate version indicates in link text that the page it leads to represents the more accessible
         version. This information may also be provided in text - the goal is to ensure that the end user knows what the
         purpose of the link is.</p>
      <p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the
         link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation,
         the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context
         available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available
         on the web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made
         available in the link text or programmatically associated with the link to satisfy
         the success criterion.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         <p>There may be situations where the purpose of the link is is supposed to be unknown
            or obscured. For instance, a game may have links identified only as door #1, door
            #2, and door #3. This link text would be sufficient because the purpose of the links
            is to create suspense for all users.</p>
      </div>
      <p>As <q>link text together with its <a>programmatically determined link context</a></q> may
         only benefit assistive technology users, see also <a href="link-purpose-link-only">2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only)</a>,
         which only relies on the link text itself.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Link Purpose (In Context)</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Links whose text clearly conveys their purpose can help all users,
            letting them skip links that they are not interested in, avoiding the need to visit the referenced
            content only to find it is not what they wanted, and having to then navigate back.
            This may be particularly of benefit to people who use a keyboard or keyboard-like interface,
            where navigation may be more laborious/require more effort, and people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</li>
         <li>Links whose purpose is conveyed through a combination of link text and <a>programmatically determined
            link context</a> will help people using assistive technologies decide whether or not to follow a
            particular link. For instance, depending on the specific technique an author has used to provide the context,
            assistive technology users may have additional context information announced automatically when a link
            receives focus, or may be able to use a shortcut to quickly explore a link's context.</li>

      <h2>Examples of Link Purpose (In Context)</h2>
      <dl>
         <dt>A link contains text that gives a description of the information at that URI</dt>
         <dd>A page contains the sentence "There was much bloodshed during the Medieval period of history." Where "Medieval period of history" is a link.</dd>
         <dt>A link is preceded by a text description of the information at that URI</dt>
         <dd>A page contains the sentence "Learn more about the Government of Ireland's Commission on Electronic Voting at Go Vote!" where "Go Vote!" is a link.</dd>
         <dt>Both an icon and text are included in the same link</dt>
         <dd>An icon of a voting machine and the text "Government of Ireland's Commission of Electronic Voting" are combined to make a single link. The alt text for the icon is null, since the purpose of the link is already described by the text of the link next to the icon.</dd>
         <dt>A list of book titles</dt>
         <dd>A list of books is available in three formats: HTML, PDF, and mp3 (a recording of a person reading the book). To avoid hearing the title of each book three times (once for each format), the first link for each book is the title of the book, the second link says "PDF" and the third says, "mp3."</dd>
         <dt>News article summaries</dt>
         <dd>A Web page contains a collection of news articles. The main page lists the first few sentences of each article, followed by a "Read more" link. A screen reader command to read the current paragraph provides the context to interpret the purpose of the link.</dd>
