   <h1>Understanding Link Purpose (In Context)</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Link Purpose (In Context)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users - and specifically users of 
         assistive technologies - understand the purpose of each link so they can decide
         whether they want to follow the link. Whenever possible, provide link text that
         identifies the purpose of the link without needing additional context.
         Assistive technology has the ability to provide users with a list of links that are
         on the Web page. Link text that is as meaningful as possible will aid users who want
         to choose from this list of links. Meaningful link text also helps those who wish to
         tab from link to link. Meaningful links help users choose which links to follow without
         requiring complicated strategies to understand the page.
      </p>
      
      <p>The text of, or associated with, the link is intended to describe the purpose of the
         link. In cases where the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name
         of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of
         the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is
         not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things may
         also describe the purpose of the link. 
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         <p>Link text does not necessarily refer to the visible text of a link. Instead - as this
            criterion is particularly aimed at assistive technology users - it refers to the link's accessible
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#dfn-name">name</a>, which is generally what assistive
            technologies will use to identify the link to users.
         </p>
      </div>

      <p><a href="page-titled" class="understanding">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> deals with the
         titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application
         being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.
         Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides
         continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on.
      </p>
      
      <p>In some situations, while the visible link text in isolation may be ambiguous, there
         is logically related text that provides the context for the link, and which is usually apparent
         from the overall layout/structure of the content. In this case, the user should be able to
         identify the purpose of the link without moving focus from the link.
         In other words, they can arrive on a link and find out more about it without
         losing their place. This can be achieved by putting the description of the link in
         the same sentence, paragraph, list item, or table cell as the link, or in the table header cell
         for a link in a data table, because these are directly associated with the link itself.
         Alternatively, authors may choose to use an ARIA technique to associate additional
         text on the page with the link.
      </p>
      
      <p>As a best practice, this context will be most usable if it precedes the link. For instance,
         if you must use ambiguous link text, it is better to put it at the end of the sentence that
         describes its destination, rather than putting the ambiguous phrase at the beginning of the
         sentence. If the description follows the link, there can be confusion and difficulty
         for screen reader users who are reading through the page in order (top to bottom).
      </p>
      
      <p>It is a best practice for links with the same destination to have consistent text
         (and this is a requirement per
         <a href="consistent-identification" class="guideline">Success Criterion 3.2.4</a> for pages in a set).
         It is also a best practice for links with different purposes and destinations to have
         different link text.
      </p>
      
     <p>A best practice for links to <a>conforming alternate versions</a> is to ensure that the link text
        to the conforming alternate version indicates in link text that the page it leads to represents the
        more accessible version. This information may also be provided as part of the visible text -
        the goal is to ensure that all end users know what the purpose of the link is.
      </p>
     
      <p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the
         link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation,
         the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context
         available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available
         on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made
         available in the link text or programmatically associated with the link to satisfy
         the Success Criterion.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>There may be situations where the purpose of the link is is supposed to be unknown
            or obscured. For instance, a game may have links identified only as door #1, door
            #2, and door #3. This link text would be sufficient because the purpose of the links
            is to create suspense for all users.

               the purpose of the link is already described by the text of the link next to the icon.

               A list of books is available in three formats: HTML, PDF, and mp3 (a recording of
               a person reading the book). To avoid hearing the title of each book three times (once
               for each format), the first link for each book is the title of the book, the second
               link says "PDF" and the third says, "mp3."

               A Web page contains a collection of news articles. The main page lists the first few
               sentences of each article, followed by a "Read more" link. A screen reader command
               to read the current paragraph provides the context to interpret the purpose of the
               link.
