      <h2>Intent of Captions (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing
         to watch synchronized media presentations. Captions provide the part of the content
         available via the audio track. Captions not only include dialogue, but identify who
         is speaking and include non-speech information conveyed through sound, including meaningful
         sound effects. 
      </p>
      
      <p>It is acknowledged that at the present time there may be difficulty in creating captions
         for time-sensitive material and this may result in the author being faced with the
         choice of delaying the information until captions are available, or publishing time-sensitive
         content that is inaccessible to the deaf, at least for the interval until captions
         are available. Over time, the tools for captioning as well as building the captioning
         into the delivery process can shorten or eliminate such delays.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Captions are not needed when the synchronized media is, itself, an alternate presentation
         of information that is also presented via text on the Web page. For example, if information
         on a page is accompanied by a synchronized media presentation that presents no more
         information than is already presented in text, but is easier for people with cognitive,
         language, or learning disabilities to understand, then it would not need to be captioned
         since the information is already presented on the page in text or in text alternatives
         (e.g., for images).

         </li>
         <li>A complex legal document contains synchronized media clips for different paragraphs
            that show a person speaking the contents of the paragraph. Each clip is associated
            with its corresponding paragraph. No captions are provided for the synchronized media.</li>
         <li>An instruction manual containing a description of a part and its necessary orientation
            is accompanied by a synchronized media clip showing the part in its correct orientation.
            No captions are provided for the synchronized media clip.</li>
         <li>
            <p>An orchestra provides captions for videos of performances. In addition to capturing
               dialog and lyrics verbatim, captions identify non-vocal music by title, movement,
               composer, and any information that will help the user comprehend the nature of the
               audio. For instance captions read,</p>

            <p>[Johann Sebastian Bach, Composer] </p>
