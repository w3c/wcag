      <h2>Intent of Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide people who are blind or visually
         impaired access to a synchronized media presentation beyond that which can be provided
         by standard audio description. This is done by periodically pausing the synchronized
         media presentation and playing additional audio description in the pauses. The synchronized media
         presentation then automatically resumes.
      </p>
      
      <p>Extended audio description can be presented to all users without a mechanism to turn it off
         ("open" extended audio description). However, extended audio description can disrupt viewing
         for those who do not need or prefer it, so mechanisms that allow users to turn the feature on
         and off are often provided ("closed" extended audio description). Alternately, versions of the
         media content with and without extended audio description can be provided.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
         
         <p>
            For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already
            integrated into and provided by the main soundtrack, it is not necessary to add standard or
            extended audio description.

      <h2>Benefits of Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>People who are blind, people with low vision who cannot see the screen, as well as
            those with cognitive limitations who have difficulty interpreting visually what is
            happening, often use audio description of the visual information. However, if there
            are not enough pauses in the foreground dialogue, standard audio description is insufficient. Extended audio description
            can provide the additional information needed to understand the video.

      <h2>Examples of Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            <em>Example 1. Video of a lecture.</em> A physics professor is giving a lecture. He makes freehand sketches on the whiteboard,
            speaking rapidly as he draws. As soon as he has finished discussing one problem, he
            erases the drawing and makes another sketch while continuing to speak and gesture
            with his other hand.  The video is paused between problems, and extended audio description
            of the professor's drawings and gestures is provided; the video is then resumed.
