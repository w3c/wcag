      <h2>Intent of Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to provide people who are blind or visually
         impaired access to a synchronized media presentation beyond that which can be provided
         by standard audio description.    This is done by periodically freezing the synchronized
         media presentation and playing additional audio description.  The synchronized media
         presentation is then resumed.  
      </p>
      
      <p>Because it disrupts viewing for those who do not need the additional description,
         techniques that allow you to turn the feature on and off are often provided.  Alternately,
         versions with and without the additional description can be provided.

      <h2>Benefits of Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>People who are blind, people with low vision who cannot see the screen, as well as
            those with cognitive limitations who have difficulty interpreting visually what is
            happening, often use audio description of the visual information. However, if there
            is too much dialogue the audio description is insufficient. Extended audio description
            can provide the additional information needed to understand the video.

      <h2>Examples of Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            <em>Example 1. Video of a lecture.</em> A physics professor is giving a lecture. The professor makes freehand sketches on the whiteboard,
            speaking rapidly while drawing. As soon as discussion on one problem is finished, the professor
            erases the drawing and makes another sketch while continuing to speak and gesture.
             The video is paused between problems, and extended audio description
            of the professor's drawings and gestures is provided; the video is then resumed.
