   <h1>Understanding Navigable</h1>

      <h2>Intent of Navigable</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this guideline is to help users find the content they need and allow
         them to keep track of their location. These tasks are often more difficult for people
         with disabilities. For finding, navigation, and orientation, it is important that
         the user can find out what the current location is. For navigation, information about
         the possible destinations needs to be available. Screen readers convert content to
         synthetic speech  which, because it is audio, must be presented in linear order. 
         Some Success Criteria in this guideline explain what provisions need to be taken to
         ensure that screen reader users can successfully navigate the content. Others allow
         users to more easily recognize navigation bars and page headers and to bypass this
         repeated content. Unusual user interface features or behaviors may confuse people
         with cognitive disabilities.
         
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Navigation has two main functions:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>to tell the user where they are</li>
         
         <li>to enable the user to go somewhere else</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>This guideline works closely with 
         <a href="adaptable" class="guideline">Guideline 1.3</a>, which ensures that any structure in the content can be perceived, a key to navigation
         as well. Headings are particularly important mechanisms for helping users orient themselves
         within content and navigate through it. Many users of assistive technologies rely
         on appropriate headings to skim through information and easily locate the different
         sections of content. Satisfying 
         <a href="info-and-relationships" class="guideline">Success Criterion 1.3.1
            
         </a> for headings also addresses some aspects of Guideline 2.4.
