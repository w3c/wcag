      <h2>Intent of Error Prevention (All)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid consequences
         that may result from making a mistake when submitting form data. This criterion builds
         on 
         <a href="error-prevention-legal-financial-data" class="guideline">Success Criterion 3.3.4</a> in that it applies to all forms that require users to submit information. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes and may have more difficulty
         detecting or recovering from mistakes. People with reading disabilities may transpose
         numbers and letters, and those with motor disabilities may hit keys by mistake. Providing
         the ability to reverse actions allows users to correct a mistake. Providing the ability
         to review and correct information gives the user an opportunity to detect a mistake
         before taking an action.
