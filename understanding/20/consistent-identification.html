   <h1>Understanding Consistent Identification</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Consistent Identification</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure consistent identification of functional
         components that appear repeatedly within a set of Web pages. A strategy that people
         who use screen readers use when operating a Web site is to rely heavily on their familiarity
         with functions that may appear on different Web pages. If identical functions have
         different labels (or, more generally, a different <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/">accessible name</a>)
         on different Web pages, the site will be considerably more difficult
         to use. It may also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for people with cognitive
         limitations. Therefore, consistent labeling will help. 
      </p>
      
      <p>This consistency extends to the text alternatives. If icons or other non-text items
         have the same functionality, then their text alternatives should be consistent as
         well.
      </p>
      
      <p>If there are two components on a web page that both have the same functionality as
         a component on another page in a set of web pages, then all 3 must be consistent.
         Hence the two on the same page will be consistent.
      </p>
      
      <p>While it is desirable and best practice always to be consistent within a single web
         page, 3.2.4 only addresses consistency within a set of web pages where something is
         repeated on more than one page in the set.
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits of Consistent Identification</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>People who learn functionality on one page on a site can find the desired functions
            on other pages if they are present.
         </li>
         
         <li>When non-text content is used in a consistent way to identify components with the
            same functionality, people with difficulty reading text or detecting text alternatives
            can interact with the Web without depending on text alternatives.
         </li>
         
         <li>People who depend on text alternatives can have a more predictable experience. They
            can also search for the component if it has a consistent label on different pages.
         </li>

      <h2>Examples of Consistent Identification</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>Example 1: Document Icon</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A document icon is used to indicate document download throughout a site. The text
               alternative for the icon always begins with the word “Download," followed by a shortened
               form of the document title. Using different text alternatives to identify document
               names for different documents is a consistent use of text alternatives.
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>Example 2: Check Mark</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A check mark icon functions as "approved", on one page but as "included" on another.
               Since they serve different functions, they have different text alternatives.
               
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>Example 3: Consistent references to other pages</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p> A Web site publishes articles on-line. Each article spans multiple Web pages and
               each page contains a link to the first page, the next page and the previous page of
               the article. If the references to the next page read "page 2", "page 3", "page 4"
               etcetera, the labels are not the same but they are consistent. Therefore, these references
               are not failures of this Success Criterion. 
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>Example 4: Icons with similar functions</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>An e-commerce application uses a printer icon that allows the user to print receipts
               and invoices. In one part of the application, the printer icon is labeled "Print receipt"
               and is used to print receipts, while in another part it is labeled "Print invoice"
               and is used to print invoices. The labeling is consistent ("Print x"), but the labels
               are different to reflect the different functions of the icons. Therefore, this example
               does not fail the Success Criterion.
               
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>Example 5: Save icon</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A common "save" icon is used through out the site where page save function is provided
               on multiple Web pages.
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>Example 6: Icon and adjacent link to same destination</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>An icon with alt text and a link are next to each other and go to the same location.
               The best practice would be to group them into one link as per 
               <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H2" class="html"></a>. However if they are visually positioned one above the other but separated in the
               source, this may not be possible. To meet the Success Criterion, the link text for
               these two links need only be consistent, not identical. But best practice is to have
               identical text so that when users encounter the second one, it is clear that it goes
               to the same place as the first.

               <strong>Example 7: Example of a Failure</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A submit "search" button on one Web page and a "find" button on another Web page both
               have a field to enter a term and list topics in the Web site related to the term submitted.
               In this case, the buttons have the same functionality but are not labeled consistently.
               
               
            </p>

                  <strong>Example 8: Failure primarily impacting assistive technology users</strong>
                                            
               </p>
               
               <p>Two buttons with the same functionality visually have the same text, but have been given
                  different <code>aria-label="..."</code> accessible names. For users of assistive technologies,
                  these two buttons will be announced differently and inconsistently.

            <p>Text alternatives that are "consistent" are not always "identical." For instance,
               you may have a graphical arrow at the bottom of a Web page that links to the next
               Web page. The text alternative may say "Go to page 4." Naturally, it would not be
               appropriate to repeat this exact text alternative on the next Web page. It would be
               more appropriate to say "Go to page 5". Although these text alternatives would not
               be identical, they would be consistent, and therefore would satisfy this Success Criterion.
            </p>
            
            <p> A single non-text-content-item may be used to serve different functions. In such
               cases, different text alternatives are necessary and should be used. Examples can
               be commonly found with the use of icons such as check marks, cross marks, and traffic
               signs. Their functions can be different depending on the context of the Web page.
               A check mark icon may function as "approved", "completed", or "included", to name
               a few, depending on the situation. Using "check mark" as text alternative across all
               Web pages does not help users understand the function of the icon. Different text
               alternatives can be used when the same non-text content serves multiple functions.
