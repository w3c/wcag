      <h2>Intent of Help</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to help users avoid making mistakes. Some
         users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes than users without disabilities.
         Using context-sensitive help, users find out how to perform an operation without losing
         track of what they are doing.
      </p>
      
      <p>Context-sensitive help only needs to be provided when the label is not
         sufficient to describe all functionality. The existence of context-sensitive help
         should be obvious to the user and they should be able to obtain it whenever they require
         it. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p>The content author may provide the help text, or the user agent may provide the help
         text based on technology-specific, programmatically determined information.

      <ul>
         
         <li>Assistance for text input helps individuals with writing disabilities and people with
            reading and intellectual disabilities who often have difficulty writing text in forms
            or other places that need text input.
         </li>
         
         <li>Additionally, these kinds of assistance help people who are aging and have the same
            difficulty in text input and/or mouse operation.
