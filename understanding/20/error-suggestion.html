      <h2>Intent of Error Suggestion</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users receive appropriate suggestions
         for correction of an input error if it is possible. The definition of "input error"
         says that it is "information provided by the user that is not accepted" by
         the system. Some examples of information that is not accepted include information
         that is required but omitted by the user and information that is provided by the user
         but that falls outside the required data format or allowed values.
      </p>
      
      <p>Success Criterion 3.3.1 provides for notification of errors. However, persons with
         cognitive limitations may find it difficult to understand how to correct the errors.
         People with visual disabilities may not be able to figure out exactly how to correct
         the error. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, users may abandon the form
         because they may be unsure of how to correct the error even though they are aware
         that it has occurred. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The content author may provide the description of the error, or the user agent may
         provide the description of the error based on technology-specific, programmatically
         determined information.
         
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits of Error Suggestion</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         <li>Providing information about how to correct input errors allows users who have learning
            disabilities to fill in a form successfully.</li>
         <li>Users who are blind or have impaired vision understand more easily the nature of the
            input error and how to correct it.</li>
         <li>People with motion impairment can reduce the number of times they need to change an
            input value.</li>
      </ul>

      <dl>
         <dt>Additional Help for Correcting An Input Error</dt>
         <dd>The result of a form that was not successfully submitted describes an
               input error in place in the page along with the correct input and offers additional
               help for the form field that caused the input error.</dd>
         <dt>Suggestions from a Limited Set of Values</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>An input field requires that a month name be entered. If the user enters "12," suggestions
               for correction may include:</p>
            
            <ul>
               <li>A list of the acceptable values, e.g., "Choose one of: January, February, March, April,
                  May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December."
               </li>
               <li>The conversion of the input data interpreted as a different month format, e.g., "Do
                  you mean 'December'?"
               </li>
            </ul>
