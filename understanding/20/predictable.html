      <h2>Intent of Predictable</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Guideline is to help users with disabilities by presenting content
         in a predictable order from Web page to Web page and by making the behavior of functional
         and interactive components predictable. It is difficult for some users to form an
         overview of the Web page: screen readers present content as a one-dimensional stream
         of synthetic speech that makes it difficult to understand spatial relationships. Users
         with cognitive limitations may become confused if components appear in different places
         on different pages.
      </p>
      
      <p>For example, people who use screen magnifiers see only part of the screen at any point
         in time; a consistent layout makes it easier for them to find navigation bars and
         other components. Placing repeated components in the same relative order within a
         set of Web pages allows users with reading disabilities to focus on an area of the
         screen rather than spending additional time decoding the text of each link. Users
         with limited use of their hands can more easily determine how to complete their tasks
         using the fewest keystrokes.
