      <h2>Intent of Low or No Background Audio</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that any non-speech sounds are low
         enough that a user who is hard of hearing can separate the speech from background
         sounds or other noise foreground speech content. 
         
         
      </p>
      
      <p>The value of 20 dB was chosen based on Large area assistive listening systems (ALS):
         Review and recommendations [[LAALS]] and In-the-ear measurements of interference in hearing aids from digital wireless
         telephones [[HEARING-AID-INT]]
