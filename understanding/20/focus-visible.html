      <h2>Intent of Focus Visible</h2>
      
      
      <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to help a person know which element has the
         keyboard focus.
      </p>
      
      <p>“Mode of operation” accounts for user agents which may not always show a focus indicator, or only show the focus indicator when the keyboard is used. User agents may optimize when the focus indicator is shown, such as only showing it when a keyboard is used. Authors are responsible for providing at least one mode of operation where the focus is visible. In most cases there is only one mode of operation so this success criterion applies. The focus indicator must not be time limited, when the keyboard focus is shown it must remain.</p>

      <div class="note">
         <p>There may be situations where mouse/pointer users could also benefit from having a visible focus indicator, even though they did not set focus to an element using the keyboard. As a best practice, consider still providing an explicit focus indicator for these cases.</p>
      </div>
      
   	<p>Note that a keyboard focus indicator can take different forms. <span class="wcag22">While Focus Visible does not specify what that form is, <a href="focus-appearance">2.4.13 Focus Appearance (Level AAA)</a> provides guidance on creating a consistent, visible indicator.</span></p>

      <h2>Benefits of Focus Visible</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>This success criterion helps anyone who relies on the keyboard to operate the page,
            by letting them visually determine the component on which keyboard operations will
            interact at any point in time.
         </li>
         <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in
            executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.
         </li>
      </ul>
      
   </section>
   
   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Focus Visible</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>When text fields receive focus, a vertical bar is displayed in the field, indicating
            that the user can insert text, OR all of the text is highlighted, indicating that
            the user can type over the text.
         </li>
         <li>When a user interface control receives focus, a visible border is displayed around
            it.
         </li>
      </ul>
