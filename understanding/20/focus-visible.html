      <h2>Intent of Focus Visible</h2>
      
      
      <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to help a person know which element has the
         keyboard focus.
      </p>
      
      <p>“Mode of operation” accounts for user agents which may not always show a focus indicator, or only show the focus indicator when the keyboard is used. User agents may optimise when the focus indicator is shown, such as only showing it when a keyboard is used. Authors are responsible for providing at least one mode of operation where the focus is visible. In most cases there is only one mode of operation so this success criterion applies. The focus indicator must not be time limited, when the keyboard focus is shown it must remain.</p>
      
   	<p>Note that a keyboard focus indicator can take different forms.<span class="wcag22"> This criterion does not specify what the form is, but <a href="focus-appearance-minimum">Focus Appearance</a> does define how visible the indicator should be. Passing <a href="focus-appearance-minimum">Focus Appearance (Minimum)</a> would pass this success criterion.</span></p>

      <h2>Benefits of Focus Visible</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>This Success Criterion helps anyone who relies on the keyboard to operate the page,
            by letting them visually determine the component on which keyboard operations will
            interact at any point in time.
         </li>
         <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in
            executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.
         </li>
      </ul>
      
   </section>
   
   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Focus Visible</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>When text fields receive focus, a vertical bar is displayed in the field, indicating
            that the user can insert text, OR all of the text is highlighted, indicating that
            the user can type over the text.
         </li>
         <li>When a user interface control receives focus, a visible border is displayed around
            it.
         </li>
