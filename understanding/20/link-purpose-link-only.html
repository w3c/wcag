      <h2>Intent of Link Purpose (Link Only)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each
         link in the content, so they can decide whether they want to follow it. Best practice
         is that links with the same destination would have the same descriptions, but links
         with different purposes and destinations would have different descriptions (see also
         
         <a href="consistent-identification" class="guideline">Success Criterion 3.2.4 Consistent Identification</a>
         which calls for consistency in identifying components that have the same functionality).
         Because the purpose of a link can be identified from its link text, links can be understood
         when they are out of context, such as when the user agent provides a list of all the
         links on a page.
      </p>
      
      <p>The text in the link is intended to describe the purpose of the link. In cases where
         the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name of the document or
         web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link (which is
         to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is not required to use
         the name of the document or web application; other things may also describe the purpose
         of the link. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <a href="page-titled" class="understanding">Success Criterion 2.4.2 Page Titled</a>
         deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application
         being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.
         Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides
         continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>The success criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the
         link cannot be determined from the information on the web page. In this situation,
         the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context
         available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available
         on the web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made
         available in the link text to satisfy the success criterion.
      </p>
      
      <p>The word "mechanism" is used to allow authors to either make all links fully understandable
         out of context by default or to provide a way to make them this way. This is done
         because for some pages, making the links all unambiguous by themselves makes the pages
         easier for some users and harder for others. Providing the ability to make the links
         unambiguous (by them selves) or not provides both users with disabilities with the
         ability to use the page in the format that best meets their needs.
      </p>
      
      <p>For example: A page listing 100 book titles along with links to download the books
         in HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, MP3, or AAC might ordinarily be viewed as the title of the
         book as a link with the words "in HTML" after it. then the sentence "Also available
         in: " followed by a series of short links with text of "HTML", "PDF", "DOC", "TXT",
         "MP3", and "AAC". At Level 3, some users could opt to view the page this way - because
         they would find the page harder to understand or slower to use if the full title of
         the book were included in each of the links. Others could opt to view the page with
         the full title as part of each of the links so that each link was understandable in
         itself. Both the former and the latter groups could include people with visual or
         cognitive disabilities that used different techniques to browse or that had different
         types or severities of disability.

      <h2>Benefits of Link Purpose (Link Only)</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>This success criterion helps people with motion impairment by letting them skip web
            pages that they are not interested in, avoiding the keystrokes needed to visit the
            referenced content and then return to the current content.
         </li>
         
         <li>People with cognitive limitations will not become disoriented by extra navigation
            to and from content they are not interested in.
         </li>
         
         <li>People with visual disabilities will benefit from not losing their place in the content
            when they return to the original page. The screen reader's list of links is more useful
            for finding information because the target of the links are described.

      <dl>
         <dt>Both an icon and text are included in the same link</dt>
         <dd>An icon of a voting machine and the text "Government of Ireland's Commission of Electronic
               Voting" are combined to make a single link.</dd>
         <dt>A list of book titles</dt>
         <dd>A list of books is available in three formats: HTML, PDF, and mp3 (a recording of
               a person reading the book). The title of the book is followed by links to the different
               formats. The rendered text for each link is just the format type, but the text associated
               with each link includes the title as well as the format; for instance, "Gulliver's
               Travels, MP3."</dd>
