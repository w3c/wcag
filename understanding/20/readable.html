      <h2>Intent of Readable</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this guideline is to allow text content to be read by users and by assistive
         technology, and to ensure that information necessary for understanding it is available.
      </p>
      
      <p>People with disabilities experience text in many different ways. For some the experience
         is visual; for some it is auditory; for some it is tactile; for still others it is
         both visual and auditory. Some users experience great difficulty in recognizing written
         words yet understand extremely complex and sophisticated documents when the text is
         read aloud, or when key processes and ideas are illustrated visually or interpreted
         as sign language. For some users, it is difficult to infer the meaning of a word or
         phrase from context, especially when the word or phrase is used in an unusual way
         or has been given a specialized meaning; for these users the ability to read and understand
         may depend on the availability of specific definitions or the expanded forms of acronyms
         or abbreviations. User agents, including speech-enabled as well as graphical applications,
         may be unable to present text correctly unless the language and direction of the text
         are identified; while these may be minor problems for most users, they can be enormous
         barriers for users with disabilities. In cases where meaning cannot be determined
         without pronunciation information (for example, certain Japanese Kanji characters),
         pronunciation information must be available as well

      <h3>Additional Techniques (Advisory) for Readable</h3>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            Setting expectations about content in the page from uncontrolled sources (future link)
            
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            Providing sign language interpretation for all content (future link) 
            
            
         </li>
         
         <li>Using the clearest and simplest language appropriate for the content (future link)

         <li>Avoiding text that is fully justified (to both left and right margins) in a way that
            causes poor spacing between words or characters (future link) 
            
         </li>
         
         <li>Using left-justified text for languages that are written left to right and right-justified
            text for languages that are written right-to-left (future link)
            
         </li>
         
         <li>Limiting text column width (future link)</li>

         </li>
         
         <li>Avoiding overuse of different styles on individual pages and in sites (future link)

         <li>Providing practical examples to clarify content (future link)</li>
         
         <li>Using a light pastel background rather than a white background behind black text (future
            link)
         </li>
         
         <li>Avoiding the use of unique interface controls unnecessarily (future link)</li>
         
         <li>Using upper and lower case according to the spelling rules of the text language (future
            link)
         </li>
         
         <li>Avoiding unusual foreign words (future link)</li>
         
         <li>
            Providing sign language versions of information, ideas, and processes that must be
            understood in order to use the content (future link)
            
         </li>
         
         <li>Making any reference to a location in a Web page into a link to that location (future

         <li>Providing easy-to-read versions of basic information about a set of Web pages, including
            information about how to contact the Webmaster (future link) 
            
         </li>
