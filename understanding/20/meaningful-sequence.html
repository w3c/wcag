   <h1>Understanding Meaningful Sequence</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Meaningful Sequence</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable a user agent to provide an alternative
         presentation of content while preserving the reading order needed to understand the
         meaning. It is important that it be possible to programmatically determine at least
         one sequence of the content that makes sense. Content that does not meet this Success
         Criterion may confuse or disorient users when assistive technology reads the content
         in the wrong order, or when alternate style sheets or other formatting changes are
         applied.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>A sequence is 
         <em>meaningful</em> if the order of content in the sequence cannot be changed without affecting its meaning.
         
         For example, if a page contains two independent articles, the relative order of the
         articles may not affect their meaning, as long as they are not interleaved. In such
         a situation, the articles themselves may have meaningful sequence, but the container
         that contains the articles may not have a meaningful sequence.
      </p>
      
      <p>The semantics of some elements define whether or not their content is a meaningful
         sequence. For instance, in HTML, text is always a meaningful sequence. Tables and
         ordered lists are meaningful sequences, but unordered lists are not.
      </p>
      
      <p>The order of content in a sequence is not always meaningful. For example, the relative
         order of the main section of a Web page and a navigation section does not affect their
         meaning. They could occur in either order in the programmatically determined reading
         sequence. As another example, a magazine article contains several callout sidebars.
         The order of the article and the sidebars does not affect their meaning. In these
         cases there are a number of different reading orders for a Web page that can satisfy
         the Success Criterion. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p>For clarity:</p>
      
      <ol>
         
         <li>Providing a particular linear order is only required where it affects meaning.</li>
         
         <li>There may be more than one order that is "correct" (according to the WCAG 2.0 definition).</li>
         
         <li>Only one correct order needs to be provided.</li>
         
      </ol>

      <h2>Benefits of Meaningful Sequence</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>This Success Criterion may help people who rely on assistive technologies that read
            content aloud. The meaning evident in the sequencing of the information in the default
            presentation will be the same when the content is presented in spoken form.
            
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
   </section>
   
   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Meaningful Sequence</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li> 
            
            <strong>Example 1:</strong> In a multi-column document, the linear presentation of the content flows from the
            top of a column to the bottom of the column, then to the top of the next column.
         </li>
         
         <li> 
            
            <strong>Example 2:</strong> CSS is used to position a navigation bar, the main story on a page, and a side story.
            The visual presentation of the sections does not match the programmatically determined
            order, but the meaning of the page does not depend on the order of the sections.
