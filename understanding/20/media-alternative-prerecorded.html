      <h2>Intent of Media Alternative (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make audio visual material available to
         individuals whose vision is too poor to reliably read 
         <a class="glossary">captions</a> and whose hearing is too poor to reliably hear dialogue and 
         <a class="glossary">audio description</a>. This is done by providing an alternative for time-based media.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>This approach involves providing all of the information in the synchronized media
         (both visual and auditory) in text form. An alternative for time-based media provides
         a running description of all that is going on in the synchronized media content. The
         alternative for time-based media reads something like a book. Unlike audio description,
         the description of the video portion is not constrained to just the pauses in the
         existing dialogue. Full descriptions are provided of all visual information, including
         visual context, actions and expressions of actors, and any other visual material.
         In addition, non-speech sounds (laughter, off-screen voices, etc.) are described,
         and transcripts of all dialogue are included. The sequence of descriptions and dialogue
         transcripts is the same as the sequence in the synchronized media itself. As a result,
         the alternative for time-based media can provide a much more complete representation
         of the synchronized media content than audio description alone.
      </p>
      
      <p>If there is any interaction as part of the synchronized media presentation (e.g.,
         "press now to answer the question") then the alternative for time-based media would
         provide hyperlinks or whatever is needed to provide parallel functionality.
      </p>
      
      <p>Individuals whose vision is too poor to reliably read captions and whose hearing is
         too poor to reliably hear dialogue can access the alternative for time-based media
         by using a refreshable braille display.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>
            For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already
            provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary. 
            
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other. This is to give the author
            some choice at the minimum conformance level, and to provide additional requirements
            at higher levels. At Level A in Success Criterion 1.2.3, authors do have the choice
            of providing either an audio description or a full text alternative. If they wish
            to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio
            description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3,
            otherwise an additional requirement. At Level AAA under Success Criterion 1.2.8 they
            must provide an extended text description. This is an additional requirement if both
            1.2.3 and 1.2.5 were met by providing an audio description only. If 1.2.3 was met,
            however, by providing a text description, and the 1.2.5 requirement for an audio description
            was met, then 1.2.8 does not add new requirements.

            <p>A community center purchases a Training video for use by its clients and puts it on
               the center's intranet. The video involves explaining use of a new technology and has
               a person talking and showing things at the same time. The community center provides
               an alternative for time-based media that all clients, including those who can neither
               see the demonstrations nor hear the explanations in the synchronized media, can use
               to better understand what is being presented.
