      <h2>Intent of Bypass Blocks</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow people who navigate sequentially
         through content more direct access to the primary content of the Web page. Web pages
         and applications often have content that appears on other pages or screens. Examples
         of repeated blocks of content include but are not limited to navigation links, header
         content, and advertising frames. Small repeated sections such as individual words,
         phrases or single links are not considered blocks for the purposes of this provision.
      </p>
      
      <p>Users who navigate sequentially through content will generally have to navigate through
         repeated content on each page. This is in contrast to a sighted user's ability to ignore
         the repeated material either by focusing on the center of the screen (where main content
         usually appears) or a mouse user's ability to select a link with a single mouse click
         rather than encountering every link or form control that comes before the item they want.
      </p>
      
      <p>It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require authors to provide methods
         that are redundant to functionality provided by the user agent. Most web browsers
         provide keyboard shortcuts to move the user focus to the top of the page, so if a
         set of navigation links is provided at the bottom of a web page providing a "skip"
         link may be unnecessary.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>Although this Success Criterion deals with blocks of content that are repeated on
            multiple pages, we also strongly promote structural markup on individual pages as
            per Success Criteria 1.3.1.
            
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <p>Although the success criterion does not specifically use the term “within a set of
         web pages”, the concept of the pages belonging to a set is implied.  An author would
         not be expected to avoid any possible duplication of content in any two pages that
         are not in some way related to each other, and are not "Web pages that share a common
         purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization” (the definition
         of set of web pages).
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>Even for web pages that are not in a set, if a web page has blocks of text that are
            repeated within the page it may be helpful (but not required) to provide a means to
            skip over them.

      <h2>Benefits of Bypass Blocks</h2>
      
      <p>When this Success Criterion is not satisfied, it may be difficult for people with
         some disabilities to reach the main content of a Web page quickly and easily:</p>
      <ul>

         
         <li>Screen reader users who visit several pages on the same site can avoid having to hear
            all header content and dozens of navigation links on every page before the main
            content is spoken.
         </li>
         
         <li>People who use only the keyboard or a keyboard interface can reach content with fewer
            keystrokes. Otherwise, they might have to make dozens of keystrokes before reaching
            a link in the main content area. This can take a long time and may cause severe physical
            pain for some users.
            
         </li>
         
         <li>People who use screen magnifiers do not have to search through the same header content or
            other blocks of information to find where the main content begins each time they enter
            a new page.
         </li>
         
         <li>People with cognitive limitations as well as people who use screen readers may benefit
            when links are grouped into lists
         </li>
         
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Bypass Blocks</h2>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>A news organization's home page contains a main story in the middle of the page, surrounded
            by many blocks and sidebars for advertising, searching, and other services. There
            is a link at the top of the page that jumps to the main story. Without using this
            link, a keyboard user needs to tab through approximately 40 links to reach the main
            story; the screen reader user has to listen to 200 words; and the screen magnifier
            user must search around for the location of the main body.
         </li>
         <li>An e-commerce website includes a long list of filters prior to the search results listing. 
            A link above the list enables users to skip the filters and get to the product results quickly.</li>
