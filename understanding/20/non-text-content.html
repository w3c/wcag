      <h2>Intent of Non-text Content</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by non-text content
         accessible through the use of a text alternative.  Text alternatives are a primary
         way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory
         modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user.
         Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of
         ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can
         have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. A person who cannot
         hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read
         it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily
         translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.

            Note on CAPTCHA
            
         </h3>
         
         <p>
            CAPTCHAs are a controversial topic in the accessibility community. As is described in the
            paper 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a>, CAPTCHAs intrinsically push the edges of human abilities in an attempt to defeat
            automated processes. Every type of CAPTCHA will be unsolvable by users with certain
            disabilities. However, they are widely used, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
            Working Group believes that if CAPTCHAs were forbidden outright, Web sites would choose
            not to conform to WCAG rather than abandon CAPTCHA. This would create barriers for
            a great many more users with disabilities. For this reason the Working Group has chosen
            to structure the requirement about CAPTCHA in a way that meets the needs of most people
            with disabilities, yet is also considered adoptable by sites. Requiring two different
            forms of CAPTCHA on a given site ensures that most people with disabilities will find
            a form they can use.
         </p>
         
         <p>Because some users with disabilities will still not be able to access sites that meet
            the minimum requirements, the Working Group provides recommendations for additional
            steps. Organizations motivated to conform to WCAG should be aware of the importance
            of this topic and should go as far beyond the minimum requirements of the guidelines
            as possible. Additional recommended steps include:
         </p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Providing more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs</li>
            
            <li>Providing access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA</li>
            
            <li>Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users</li>
            
         </ul>

         <h3>Additional information</h3>
         
         <p>Non-text content can take a number of forms, and this Success Criterion specifies
            how each is to be handled.
         </p>
         
         <p> 
            
            <strong>
               For non-text content that is not covered by one of the other situations listed below,
            </strong>
            such as charts, diagrams, audio recordings, pictures, and animations, text alternatives
            can make the same information available in a form that can be rendered through any
            modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile).  Short and long text alternatives
            can be used as needed to convey the information in the non-text content.  Note that
            
            <strong>
               prerecorded
               audio-only
            </strong> and 
            
            <strong> prerecorded
               video-only
            </strong> files are covered here.  
            <strong>
               Live-audio-only
            </strong> and 
            <strong>
               Live-video-only
            </strong> files are covered below (see 3rd paragraph following this one).  
         </p>
         
         <p> 
            
            <strong>
               For non-text content that is a control or accepts user input
            </strong>, such as images used as submit buttons, image maps or complex animations, a name
            is provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content so that the person at
            least knows what the non-text content is and why it is there.
         </p>
         
         <p> 
            
            <strong>
               Non-text content that is time-based media
            </strong>
            is made accessible through 
            <a href="time-based-media">1.2: Time-Based Media</a>.  However, it is important that users know what it is when they encounter it on a
            page so they can decide what action if any they want to take with it.  A text alternative
            that describes the time-based media and/or gives its title is therefore provided.
            
         </p>
         
         <p> 
            
            <strong>
               For Live Audio-only and live video-only content
            </strong>, it can be much more difficult to provide text alternatives that provide equivalent
            information as live audio-only and live video-only content. For these types of non-text
            content, text alternatives provide a descriptive label.  
            
         </p>
         
         <p> 
            
            <strong>
               Sometimes a test or exercise must be partially or completely presented in non-text
               format.
            </strong>  Audio or visual information is provided that cannot be changed to text because the
            test or exercise must be conducted using that sense.  For example, a hearing test
            would be invalid if a text alternative were provided.  A visual skill development
            exercise would similarly make no sense in text form.  And a spelling test with text
            alternatives would not be very effective.  For these cases, text alternatives should
            be provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content; of course, the text alternatives
            would not provide the same information needed to pass the test. 
         </p>
         
         <p> 
            
            <strong>
               Sometimes content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience
            </strong> that words cannot fully capture. Examples include a symphony performance, works of
            visual art etc. For such content, text alternatives at least identify the non-text
            content with a descriptive label and where possible, additional descriptive text.
            If the reason for including the content in the page is known and can be described
            it is helpful to include that information. 
         </p>
         
         <p> 
            
            <strong>Sometimes there are non-text exercises that are used to prove you are human.</strong> To avoid spam robots and other software from gaining access to a site a device called
            a CAPTCHA is used. These usually involve visual or auditory tasks that are beyond
            the current capabilities of Web robots. Providing a text alternative to them would
            however make them operable by Robots, thus defeating their purpose. In this case a
            text alternative would describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA, and alternate forms using
            different modalities would be provided to address the needs of people with different
            disabilities.
         </p>
         
         <p> 
            
            <strong>
               Sometimes there is non-text content that really is not meant to be seen or understood
               by the user.
            </strong> Transparent images used to move text over on a page; an invisible image that is used
            to track usage statistics; and a swirl in the corner that conveys no information but
            just fills up a blank space to create an aesthetic effect are all examples of this.
            Putting alternative text on such items just distracts people using screen readers
            from the content on the page. Not marking the content in any way, though, leaves users
            guessing what the non-text content is and what information they may have missed (even
            though they have not missed anything in reality). This type of non-text content, therefore,
            is marked or implemented in a way that assistive technologies (AT) will ignore it
            and not present anything to the user.

         <li>This Success Criterion helps people who have difficulty perceiving visual content.
            Assistive technology can read text aloud, present it visually, or convert it to braille.
         </li>
         
         <li>Text alternatives may help some people who have difficulty understanding the meaning
            of photographs, drawings, and other images  (e.g., line drawings, graphic designs,
            paintings, three-dimensional representations), graphs, charts, animations, etc.
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            People who are deaf, are hard of hearing, or who are having trouble understanding
            audio information for any reason can read the text presentation. Research is ongoing
            regarding automatic translation of text into sign language. 
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            People who are deaf-blind can read the text in braille.
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            Additionally, text alternatives support the ability to search for non-text content
            and to repurpose content in a variety of ways.
