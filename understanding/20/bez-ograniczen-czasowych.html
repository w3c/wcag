      <h2>Intent of No Timing</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to minimize the occurrence of content that
         requires timed interaction. This enables people with blindness, low vision, cognitive
         limitations, or motor impairments to interact with content. This differs from the
         Level A Success Criterion in that the only exception is for real-time events.

      <h2>Benefits of No Timing</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>People with physical disabilities often need more time to react, to type and to complete
            activities.  People with low vision need more time to locate things on screen and
            to read.   People who are blind and using screen readers may need more time to understand
            screen layouts, to find information and to operate controls.  People who have cognitive
            or language limitations need more time to read and to understand.  People who are
            deaf and communicate in sign language may need more time to read information printed
            in text (which may be a second language for some).
         </li>
         
         <li>In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating audio content to
            a user who is deaf, control over time limits is also important.
         </li>

      <h2>Examples of No Timing</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>A test is designed so that time to complete the test does not affect the scoring</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>Rather than calibrating an on-line test using a time limit, the test is calibrated
               based on scores when users have no time limits.
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>A game is designed so that users take turns rather than competing in real-time</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>One party can pause the game without invalidating the competitive aspect of it.</p>
