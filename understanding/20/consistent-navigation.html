      <h2>Intent of Consistent Navigation</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage the use of consistent presentation
         and layout for users who interact with repeated content within 
         a set of Web pages and need to locate specific information or functionality more than
         once.
         Individuals with low vision who use screen magnification to display a small portion
         of the screen at a time often use visual cues and page boundaries to quickly locate
         repeated content.
         Presenting repeated content in the same order is also important for visual users who
         use spatial memory or visual cues within the design to locate repeated content.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>It is important to note that the use of the phrase "same order" in this section is
         not meant to imply that subnavigation menus cannot be used or that blocks of secondary
         navigation or page structure cannot be used. Instead, this Success Criterion is intended
         to assist users who interact with repeated content across Web pages to be able to
         predict the location of the content they are looking for and find it more quickly
         when they encounter it again. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Users may initiate a change in the order by using adaptive user agents or by setting
         preferences so that the information is presented in a way that is most useful to them.

            <li>Ensuring that repeated components occur in the same order on each page of a site helps
               users become comfortable that they will able to predict where they can find things
               on each page. This helps users with 
               <strong>cognitive limitations</strong>, users with 
               <strong>low vision</strong>, users with 
               <strong>intellectual disabilities</strong>, and also those who are 
               <strong>blind</strong>.

      <h2>Examples of Consistent Navigation</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>A consistently located control</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A search field is the last item on every Web page in a site. users can quickly locate
               the search function. 
               
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>An expanding navigation menu</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A navigation menu includes a list of seven items with links to the main sections of
               a site.
               When a user selects one of these items, a list of subnavigation items is inserted
               into the top-level navigation menu.
               
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>Consistently positioned skip navigation controls</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A "skip navigation" (or "skip to main content") link is included as the first link
               on every page in a Web site. The link allows users to quickly bypass heading information
               and navigational content and begin interacting with the main content of a page.
               
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               								       
               <strong>Skip to navigation link</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>Navigational content is consistently located at the end of each page in a set of Web
               pages. A "skip to navigation" link is consistently located at the beginning of each
               page so that keyboard users can easily locate it when needed.
