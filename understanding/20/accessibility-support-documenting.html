   <h1>Documenting Accessibility Support for Uses of a Web Technology</h1>
   			
   			
   <p>The documentation of accessibility support for uses of a Web technology  provides
      the information needed to determine whether it is possible to  satisfy the WCAG 2.0
      Success Criteria for a particular environment. 
   </p>
   			
   <p>Accessibility Support documentation for uses of a Web technology includes the following
      information: 
   </p>
   			
   <ul>
      				
      <li> The version or versions of the technology </li>
      				
      <li>
         					
         <p> For each user agent or plug-in that supports this version of the technology:</p>
         					
         <ul>
            						
            <li> The version of the user agent or plug-in, including the operating system or platform
               
            </li>
            						
            <li> Ways of using the technology that are supported by the user agent; ideally, there
               are ways to meet all of the success criteria, but exceptions should be noted. 
            </li>
            						
            <li> Known limitations of the user agent support for uses of the technology to meet Success
               Criteria
               							
            </li>
            					
         </ul>
         				
      </li>
      				
      <li>
         					
         <p> For each assistive technology that supports the Web technology:</p>
         					
         <ul>
            						
            <li> The version of the assistive technology, including the operating system or platform
               
            </li>
            					
         </ul>
         				
      </li>
      				
      <li>
         					
         <p> For each host user agent that is supported by this version of the assistive technology:</p>
         					
         <ul>
            						
            <li> Ways of using the technology supported by the assistive technology for this user
               agent 
            </li>
            						
            <li> Known limitations in the support of uses of the technology to meet success criteria
               when using the assistive technology with this user agent 
            </li>
            					
         </ul>
         				
      </li>
      			
   </ul>
   			
   <p>Target environments are defined by the user agents and assistive technologies available
      to its users. Documentation of accessibility support involves detailed understanding
      of the ways to use functionality of a  technology to meet success criteria, and also
      of user agents and assistive technology. Because of this, vendors and developers of
      Web technologies and user agents are encouraged to provide this information about
      the accessibility  support of their products. Similarly, developers and vendors of
      assistive technology are encouraged to provide this information about  the ways to
      use Web technologies  that are supported by their products. Authors should need to
      document the accessibility supported ways to use a technology only  when there is
      not reliable documentation available from vendors or  testing groups for those uses.
      
   </p>
   			
   <p>For a controlled environment, such as a corporate workplace,  the user agents and
      assistive technologies available may be a specific  set of versions of user agents
      on a specific set of platforms. To  determine whether uses of a Web technology are
      accessibility supported in a  target environment, an author checks that the user agents
      and assistive  technologies available are in the set of supported user agents and
      assistive technologies listed for those uses in the Accessibility Support  documentation.
      
   </p>
   			
   <p>For a target environment like the Internet, authors may need  to consider a much larger
      set of user agents, including older versions,  and on a wider variety of platforms.
      
   </p>
   			
   <p>Environments that use different natural languages are different target environments.
      For example, the accessibility-supported ways of using technologies for an English
      language environment may differ from those  for an Arabic language environment, since
      there may be different user agents and assistive technologies that support these languages.
   </p>
   			
   <p>The documentation includes version-specific information about all the assistive technologies
      and all the user agents and the ways  that they interact with one another. If support
      in these user agents is  similar, it will be straightforward for an author to decide
      if a documented way of using a technology is accessibility supported. If the uses
      supported are different in different versions, authors can only rely on the uses that
      are supported in the versions available to their users in  determining accessibility
      support. 
   </p>
   			
   <p>If a way of using a technology is not relied upon for conformance, the absence of
      accessibility support for that use does not prevent conformance of the Web page. So
      if the unsupported use does not occur in the content, or if there is a conforming
      version of that content available, the Web page still conforms. For instance, lack
      of accessibility support for interactive controls in a Web technology would not prevent
      uses of the Web technology for non-interactive content that are accessibility supported.
