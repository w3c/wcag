         form of abbreviations.

         <h3>Benefits of Abbreviations</h3>
         
         
         <p>This Success Criterion may help people who:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>have difficulty decoding words;</li>
            
            <li>rely on screen magnifiers (magnification may reduce contextual cues);</li>
            
            <li>have limited memory;</li>
            
            <li>have difficulty using context to aid understanding.</li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>
            Abbreviations may confuse some readers in different ways:
         </p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Some abbreviations do not look like normal words and cannot be pronounced according
               to the usual rules of the language. For example, the English word "room" is abbreviated
               as "rm," which does not correspond to any English word or phoneme. The user has to
               know that "rm" is an abbreviation for the word "room" in order to say it correctly.
            </li>
            
            <li>Sometimes, the same abbreviation means different things in different contexts. For
               example, in the English sentence "Dr. Johnson lives on Boswell Dr.," the first "Dr."
               is an abbreviation for "Doctor" and the second instance is an abbreviation for the
               word "Drive" (a word that means "street"). Users must be able to understand the context
               in order to know what the abbreviations mean.
            </li>
            
            <li>Some acronyms spell common words but are used in different ways. For example, "JAWS"
               is an acronym for a screen reader whose full name is "Job Access with Speech." It
               is also a common English word referring to the part of the mouth that holds the teeth.
               The acronym is used differently than the common word.
            </li>
            
            <li>Some acronyms sound like common words but are spelled differently. For example, the
               acronym for Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language, S M I L, is pronounced like
               the English word "smile." 
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>It would also help people with visual disabilities who:</p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Lose context when zoomed-in with a screen magnifier</li>
            
         </ul>

            <p>A Web site includes a search form provided by an on-line acronym service. Users enter
               an acronym and the form returns a list of possible expansions from the sources that
               it searched.

            <p>A medical Web site provides information for both doctors and patients. The site includes
               a set of cascading dictionaries;  a very specialized medical dictionary is first,
               followed by a second medical dictionary for the general public. The cascade also includes
               a list of acronyms and abbreviations that are unique to the site, and finally there
               is a standard dictionary as well. The standard dictionary at the end of the list provides
               definitions for most words in the text. The specialized medical dictionary yields
               definitions of unusual medical terms. Definitions for words that appear in more than
               one dictionary are listed in the order of the cascade. The meaning of acronyms and
               abbreviations is provided by the list of acronyms and abbreviations.

               abbreviation. Other user agents might make the expanded form available as a tooltip
               or as contextual help for the abbreviation.
