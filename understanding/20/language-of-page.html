      <h2>Intent of Language of Page</h2>
      
      
      <p>
         The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content developers provide
         information in the Web page that user agents need to present text and other linguistic
         content correctly. Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render
         text more accurately when the language of the Web page is identified. Screen readers
         can load the correct pronunciation rules. Visual browsers can display characters and
         scripts correctly. Media players can show captions correctly. As a result, users with
         disabilities will be better able to understand the content.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>The default human language of the Web page is the default text-processing language
         as discussed in 
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-lang/">Internationalization Best Practices: Specifying Language in XHTML &amp; HTML Content</a>. When a Web page uses several languages, the default text-processing language is
         the language which is used most. (If several languages are used equally, the first
         language used should be chosen as the default human language.) 
         
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>
            For multilingual sites targeting Conformance Level A, the Working Group strongly encourages
            developers to follow Success Criterion 3.1.2 as well even though that is a Level AA
            Success Criterion.

         <ul>
            
            <li>people who use screen readers or other technologies that convert text into synthetic

            <li>people who find it difficult to read written material with fluency and accuracy, such
               as recognizing characters and alphabets or decoding words;
            </li>
            
            <li>people with certain cognitive, language and learning disabilities who use text-to-speech
