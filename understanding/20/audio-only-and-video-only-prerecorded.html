      <h2>Intent of Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by prerecorded
         audio-only and prerecorded video-only content available to all users. Alternatives
         for time-based media that are text based make information accessible because text
         can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile)
         to match the needs of the user. In the future, text could also be translated into
         symbols, sign language or simpler forms of the language (future).
      </p>
      
      <p>An example of pre-recorded video with no audio information or user interaction is
         a silent movie. The purpose of the transcript is to provide an equivalent to what
         is presented visually. For prerecorded video content, authors have the option to provide
         an audio track. The purpose of the audio alternative is to be an equivalent to the
         video. This makes it possible for users with and without vision impairment to review
         content simultaneously. The approach can also make it easier for those with cognitive,
         language and learning disabilities to understand the content because it would provide
         parallel presentation.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>A text equivalent is not required for audio that is provided as an equivalent for
            video with no audio information.  For example, it is not required to caption audio
            description that is provided as an alternative to a silent movie.

      <h2>Benefits of Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>This Success Criterion helps people who have difficulty perceiving visual content.
            Assistive technology can read text alternatives aloud, present them visually, or convert
            them to braille.
         </li>
         
         <li>Alternatives for timed-based media that are text based may help some people who have
            difficulty understanding the meaning of prerecorded video content.
         </li>
         
         <li>People who are deaf, are hard of hearing, or who are having trouble understanding
            audio information for any reason can read the text presentation. Research is ongoing
            regarding automatic translation of text into sign language.
         </li>
         
         <li>People who are deaf-blind can read the text in braille.</li>
         
         <li>Additionally, text supports the ability to search for non-text content and to repurpose
            content in a variety of ways.
         </li>

      <h2>Examples of Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      <dl>
         <dt>An audio recording of a speech</dt>
         <dd>The link to an audio clip says, "Chairman's speech to the assembly." A link to a text
               transcript is provided immediately after the link to the audio clip.</dd>
         <dt>An audio recording of a press conference</dt>
         <dd>A Web page includes a link to an audio recording of a press conference that identifies
               the audio recording. The page also links to a text transcript of the press conference.
               The transcript includes a verbatim record of everything the speakers say. It identifies
               who is speaking as well as noting other significant sounds that are part of the recording,
               such as applause, laughter, questions from the audience, and so on.</dd>
         <dt>An animation that illustrates how a car engine works</dt>
         <dd>An animation shows how a car engine works. There is no audio and the animation is
               part of a tutorial that describes how an engine works. Since the text of the tutorial
               already provides a full explanation, the media is an alternative for text and the
               text alternative includes only a brief description of the animation and refers to
               the tutorial text for more information.</dd>
         <dt>A video-only file with an audio track</dt>
         <dd>A silent movie includes an audio track which includes a description of the action in the video.</dd>
