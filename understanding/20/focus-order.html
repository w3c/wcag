      <h2>Intent of Focus Order</h2>
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that when users navigate sequentially
         through content, they encounter information in an order that is consistent with the
         meaning of the content and can be operated from the keyboard. This reduces confusion
         by letting users form a consistent mental model of the content. There may be different
         orders that reflect logical relationships in the content. For example, moving through
         components in a table one row at a time or one column at a time both reflect the logical
         relationships in the content. Either order may satisfy this success criterion.
      </p>
      
      <p>The way that sequential navigation order is determined in web content is defined by
         the technology of the content. For example, simple HTML defines sequential navigation
         via the notion of tabbing order. Dynamic HTML may modify the navigation sequence using
         scripting along with the addition of a <code>tabindex</code> attribute to allow focus to additional
         elements. If no scripting or <code>tabindex</code> attributes are used, the navigation order is
         the order that components appear in the content stream. (See <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus"><cite>Focus</cite> in the HTML Living Standard</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>An example of keyboard navigation that is not the sequential navigation addressed
         by this success criterion is using arrow key navigation to traverse a tree component.
         The user can use the up and down arrow keys to move from tree node to tree node. Pressing
         the right arrow key may expand a node, then using the down arrow key, will move into
         the newly expanded nodes. This navigation sequence follows the expected sequence for
         a tree control - as additional items get expanded or collapsed, they are added or
         removed from the navigation sequence.
      </p>
      
      <p>The focus order may not be identical to the programmatically determined reading order
         (see <a href="meaningful-sequence.html">Success Criterion 1.3.2</a>) as long as the user can still understand and operate
         the web page. Since there may be several possible logical reading orders for the content,
         the focus order may match any of them. However, when the order of a particular presentation
         differs from the programmatically determined reading order, users of one of these
         presentations may find it difficult to understand or operate the web page. Authors
         should carefully consider all these users as they design their web pages.
      </p>
      
      <p>For example, a screen reader user interacts with the programmatically determined reading
         order, while a sighted keyboard user interacts with the visual presentation of the
         web page. Care should be taken so that the focus order makes sense to both of these
         sets of users and does not appear to either of them to jump around randomly. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Focus order needs to allow the user to navigate focusable elements in a logical order,
         and that order needs to preserve any meaning or operation that the page is conveying. 
         Focus order does not necessarily need to follow the visual layout of the web page,
         as long as the order in which elements receive focus is logical, and the hierarchy and relationship
         of content implied by the visual presentation is preserved. For instance, in a two-column
         layout, the assumption in western left-to-right systems may be that focus moves through the elements in the
         left-hand column first, from the top to the bottom of the column, and then proceed to the right-hand column.
         However, if the two columns are independent of each other, and meaning/operation are not affected, it is not
         a failure if elements in the right-hand column receive focus first, followed by the elements in the left-hand column.
         As a best practice, though, make sure the focus order reinforces the reading order implied by the visual layout.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
        <p>This requirement does not specify what should or should not receive focus, but rather assesses the order in which elements receive focus. This success criterion does not prohibit making non-operable content (e.g., static text) focusable, or programmatically moving focus to such content. However, it is a failure of Focus Order if items receive focus in an order that impedes the meaning or operation of content, or creates confusing or illogical focus orders â€” for example,
         a control appearing to receive focus multiple times due to the use of nested focusable elements.</p>
         <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;button&gt;...&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
         <p>As a best practice, avoid having focusable elements which cannot be operated
         or actioned, as these are likely to make operation tedious for keyboard users.</p>

      <p>For clarity:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Focusable components need to receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and
            operability.
         </li>
         
         <li>Focus order does not necessarily need to follow the visual presentation or layout.</li>
         
         <li>If there is more than one order that preserves meaning and operability, only one of
            them needs to be provided.
         </li>
         
         <li>Static/non-interactive elements can receive focus, as long as they don't
            impede operation of the content, or result in confusing or illogical focus order.
         </li>

      <h2>Benefits of Focus Order</h2>
      
      <p>These techniques benefit keyboard users who navigate documents sequentially and expect
         the focus order to be consistent with the sequential reading order.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>People with mobility impairments who must rely on keyboard access for operating a
            page benefit from a logical, usable focus order.
         </li>
         
         <li>People with disabilities that make reading difficult can become disoriented when tabbing
            takes focus someplace unexpected. They benefit from a logical focus order.
         </li>
         
         <li>People with visual impairments can become disoriented when tabbing takes focus someplace
            unexpected or when they cannot easily find the content surrounding an interactive
            element.
         </li>
         
         <li>Only a small portion of the page may be visible to an individual using a screen magnifier
            at a high level of magnification. Such a user may interpret a field in the wrong context
            if the focus order is not logical.

      <h2>Examples of Focus Order</h2>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>On a web page that contains a tree of interactive controls, the user can use the up
            and down arrow keys to move from tree node to tree node. Pressing the right arrow
            key expands a node, then using the down arrow key moves into the newly expanded nodes.
         </li>
         
         <li>A web page implements modeless dialogs. When the trigger button is activated,
            a dialog opens. The interactive elements in the dialog are inserted in the focus order
            immediately after the button. When the dialog is open, the focus order goes from the
            button to the elements of the dialog, then to the interactive element following the
            button. When the dialog is closed, the focus order goes from the button to the following
            element.
         </li>
         
         <li>A web page implements modal dialogs. When the trigger button is activated,
            a dialog opens and focus is set within the dialog. As
            long as the dialog is open, all web page content outside the dialog becomes 
            inert and cannot receive focus (though, depending on implementation, the focus cycle
            might still include user agent controls). When the
            dialog is dismissed, focus returns to the button or the element following the button.
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>An HTML web page is created with the left hand navigation occurring in the HTML after
               the main body content, and styled with CSS to appear on the left hand side of the
               page. This is done to allow focus to move to the main body content first without requiring
               <code>tabindex</code> attributes or JavaScript.
            </p>
            
            <div class="note">
               
               <p>While this example passes the Success Criterion, it is not necessarily true that all
                  CSS positioning would. More complex positioning examples may or may not preserve meaning
                  and operability

         <li>
            
            <p>The following example <strong>fails to meet the Success Criterion</strong>:</p>
            
            <p>A company's website includes a form that collects marketing data and allows users
               to subscribe to several newsletters published by the company. The section of the form
               for collecting marketing data includes fields such as name, street address, city,
               state or province, and postal code. Another section of the form includes several checkboxes
               so that users can indicate newsletters they want to receive. However, the tab order
               for the form skips between fields in different sections of the form, so that focus
               moves from the name field to a checkbox, then to the street address, then to another
               checkbox.</p>
