      <p>Everyone makes mistakes. However, people with some disabilities have more difficulty
         creating error-free input. In addition, it may be harder for them to detect that they
         have made an error. Typical error indication methods may not be obvious to them because
         of a limited field of view, limited color perception, or use of assistive technology.
         This guideline seeks to reduce the number of serious or irreversible errors that are
         made, increase the likelihood that all errors will be noticed by the user, and help
         users understand what they should do to correct an error.
