      <h2>Intent of Audio-only (Live)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to make information conveyed by live audio,
         such as web-based audio conferencing, live speeches and radio Webcasts, accessible through the
         use of a text alternative. A live text caption service will enable live audio to be
         accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who cannot otherwise hear
         the audio. Such services use a trained human operator who listens in to what is being
         said and uses a special keyboard to enter the text with only a small delay. They are
         able to capture a live event with a high degree of fidelity, and also to insert notes
         on any non spoken audio which is essential to understanding the event. A transcript
         is sometimes a possibility if the live audio is following a set script; but a live
         caption service is preferred because it plays out at the same pace as the audio itself,
         and can adapt to any deviations from the script that might occur.
      </p>
      
      <p>Using untrained operators, or providing a transcript which differs markedly from what
         actually happens would not be considered meeting this success criterion. 
      </p>
      
      <p>This success criterion was intended to apply to broadcast of audio and is not intended
         to require that two-way audio calls between two or more individuals through web apps
         must be captioned regardless of the needs of users. Responsibility for providing captions
         would fall to the content providers (the callers) or the “host” caller, and not the
         application.

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Audio-only (Live)</h2>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>A public relations firm uses web-based caption services to cover live events; the
            output from the service is incorporated in a sub frame of the web page which includes
            the streaming audio control.
         </li>
         
         <li>A live radio play of a fringe theatre group is being broadcast to the web. As the
            actors stick largely to a set script, and the budget for the program is small, the
            producers provide a link (with the playwright's permission) to the script of the play.
         </li>
         
         <li>A streaming audio server uses a technology which can also accommodate text and graphics,
            such as HTML. A stenographer is used to create live captions at an
            event, and these are mixed on the fly to produce live captions in the media stream
            which can be viewed by the media player. 
         </li>
         
         <li>A CEO is to give a press release by telephone to the media in response to a breaking
            news story, the audio is being recorded and streamed over the internet, but due to
            time constraints a web captioning service cannot be set up in time. As the press release
            is a set statement which the CEO will be reading out, the company simultaneously provides
            the transcript of the release.
