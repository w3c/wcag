      <h2>Intent of On Focus</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that functionality is predictable
         as visitors navigate their way through a document. Any component that is able to trigger
         an event when it receives focus must not change the context.          Examples of
         changing context when a component receives focus include, but are not limited to:
         
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>forms submitted automatically when a component receives focus;</li>
         
         <li>new windows launched when a component receives focus;</li>
         
         <li>focus is changed to another component when that component receives focus;</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>Focus may be moved to a control either via the keyboard (e.g. tabbing to a control) or the mouse (e.g. clicking on a text field). Moving the mouse over a control does not move the focus
         unless scripting implements this behavior. Note that for some types of controls, clicking
         on a control may also activate the control (e.g. button), which may, in turn, initiate a change in context.

      <div class="note">
         
         <p>What is meant by "component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element"
            or "user interface component".

      <h2>Benefits of On Focus</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>This Success Criterion helps people with visual disabilities, cognitive limitations,
            and motor impairments by reducing the chance that a change of context will occur unexpectedly.

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of On Focus</h2>
      
      <dl>
         <dt>Example 1: A dropdown menu</dt>
         <dd>A dropdown menu on a page allows users to choose between jump destinations. If the
               person uses the keyboard to move down to a choice and activates it (with a spacebar
               or enter key) it will jump to a new page.  However, if the person moves down to a
               choice and either hits the escape or the tab key to move out of the pulldown menu
               â€“ it does not jump to a new screen as the focus shifts out of the dropdown menu.</dd>
         <dt>Example of a Failure: A help dialog</dt>
         <dd>When a field receives focus, a help dialog window describing the field and providing
               options opens. As a keyboard user tabs through the Web page, the dialog opens, moving
               the keyboard focus away from the control every time the user attempts to tab past
               the field.</dd>
