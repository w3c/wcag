      <h2>Intent of Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide people who are blind or visually
         impaired access to the visual information in a synchronized media presentation. This
         Success Criterion describes two approaches, either of which can be used.
      </p>
      
      <p>One approach is to provide audio description of the video content. The audio description
         augments the audio portion of the presentation with the information needed when the
         video portion is not available. During existing pauses in dialogue, audio description
         provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text
         that  are important and are not described or spoken in the main sound track.
      </p>
      
      <p>The second approach involves providing all of the information in the synchronized
         media (both visual and auditory) in text form. An alternative for time-based media
         provides a running description of all that is going on in the synchronized media content.
         The alternative for time-based media reads something like a screenplay or book. Unlike
         audio description, the description of the video portion is not constrained to just
         the pauses in the existing dialogue. Full descriptions are provided of all visual
         information, including visual context, actions and expressions of actors, and any
         other visual material. In addition, non-speech sounds (laughter, off-screen voices,
         etc.) are described, and transcripts of all dialogue are included. The sequence of
         description and dialogue transcripts are the same as the sequence in the synchronized
         media itself. As a result, the alternative for time-based media can provide a much
         more complete representation of the synchronized media content than audio description
         alone.
      </p>
      
      <p>If there is any interaction as part of the synchronized media presentation (e.g.,
         "press now to answer the question") then the alternative for time-based media would
         provide hyperlinks or whatever is needed to provide the same functionality.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>
            For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already
            provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary. 
            
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other. This is to give the author
            some choice at the minimum conformance level, and to provide additional requirements
            at higher levels. At Level A in Success Criterion 1.2.3, authors do have the choice
            of providing either an audio description or a full text alternative. If they wish
            to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio
            description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3,
            otherwise an additional requirement. At Level AAA under Success Criterion 1.2.8 they
            must provide an extended text description. This is an additional requirement if both
            1.2.3 and 1.2.5 were met by providing an audio description only. If 1.2.3 was met,
            however, by providing a text description, and the 1.2.5 requirement for an audio description
            was met, then 1.2.8 does not add new requirements.

         <dd>
            <p>
               <strong>Describer: </strong>A title, "Teaching Evolution Case Studies. Bonnie Chen." A teacher shows photographs
               of birds with long, thin beaks.
            </p>
            
            <p> 
               <strong>Bonnie Chen: </strong>"These photos were all taken at the Everglades."
            </p>
            
            <p> 
               <strong>Describer: </strong>The teacher hands each student two flat, thin wooden sticks.
            </p>
            
            <p> 
               <strong>Bonnie Chen: </strong>"Today you will pretend to be a species of wading bird that has a beak like this."
            </p>
            
            <p> 
               <strong>Describer: </strong>The teacher holds two of the sticks to her mouth making the shape of a beak.

         <dt>An alternative for time-based media for a training video</dt>
         <dd>A company purchases a Training video for use by its employees and puts it on the companies
               intranet. The video involves explaining use of a new technology and has a person talking
               and showing things at the same time. Since there is no place to insert audio description
               of the visual demonstrations during gaps in dialogue, the company provides an alternative
               for time-based media that all employees, including those who cannot see the demonstrations,
               can use to better understand what is being presented.</dd>
