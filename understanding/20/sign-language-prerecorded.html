      <h2>Intent of Sign Language (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing
         and who are fluent in a sign language to understand the content of the audio track
         of synchronized media presentations. Written text, such as that found in captions,
         is often a second language. Because sign language provides the ability to provide
         intonation, emotion and other audio information that is reflected in sign language
         interpretation, but not in captions, sign language interpretation provides richer
         and more equivalent access to synchronized media. People who communicate extensively
         in sign language are also faster in sign language and synchronized media is a time-based
         presentation.

      <h2>Benefits of Sign Language (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>People whose human language is a sign language sometimes have limited reading ability.
            These individuals may not be able to read and comprehend the captions and thus require
            a sign language interpretation to gain access to the synchronized media content.

      <h2>Examples of Sign Language (Prerecorded)</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li> 
            
            <strong> Example 1.</strong> A corporation is making an important announcement to all of its employees. The announcement
            will be held in the main headquarters and later streamed to the Web. A sign language interpreter
            is provided at the announcement location for the employees that are present in the meeting room. For the Web version of
            the announcement, the sign language interpreter is shown/superimposed in the corner of the display.
         </li>
         
         <li> 
            
            <strong> Example 2.</strong> A university is providing an online version of a particular lecture by creating
            a synchronized media presentation of the professor delivering the lecture. The presentation
            includes video of the professor speaking and demonstrating a science experiment. A
            sign language interpretation of the lecture is created after the lecture and presented on the Web with
            the synchronized media version.
