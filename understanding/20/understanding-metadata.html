   <h1>Understanding Metadata</h1>
   			
   			
   <p>This section discusses metadata techniques that can be employed to  satisfy WCAG 2.0
      Success Criteria. For more information about metadata  see resources below. 
   </p>
   			
   <p>At its most basic level, metadata is essentially 'data about data' and is used to
      both describe and find resources. 
   </p>
   			
   <p>Metadata is a powerful tool that can be used for describing Web  pages and accessible
      components of Web pages as well as associating  alternate versions of Web content
      to each other. These descriptions in  turn allows users to locate specific information
      they need or prefer. 
   </p>
   			
   <p>In conjunction with WCAG, metadata can play a number of roles including: </p>
   			
   <ul>
      				
      <li> Metadata can be used to associate conforming alternate  versions of Web pages with
         Web pages which do not conform, in order to  allow users to find the conforming alternate
         version when they land on  a non-conforming page that they cannot use. 
      </li>
      				
      <li> Metadata can be used to locate and also to describe  alternate pages where there
         are multiple versions of a page which have  been developed, especially where the alternate
         pages are optimized for  individuals with different disabilities. The user can use
         the metadata  both to locate the alternate versions and to identify characteristics
         of the versions, so that they can find the one that best meets their  needs. 
      </li>
      				
      <li>In addition to being used for whole pages (as in #1 and #2  above), metadata can be
         used to describe alternate versions of  subcomponents of a page. Again, the metadata
         can be used to find  alternate versions of a Web page component as well as to get
         descriptions of the alternate versions ( if there are several) in order  to determine
         which one would best meet the user's needs. 
      </li>
      			
   </ul>

      <h2>Metadata Resources</h2>
      				
      <p>Metadata descriptions often provide values from defined, agreed  vocabularies such
         as the resource's subject matter or its date of  publication, and are machine readable
         - software that understands the  metadata scheme in use can do useful tasks not feasible
         otherwise.  Typically, an object having metadata may have one or more such metadata
         descriptions. 
      </p>
      				
      <p>Well-known specifications (schemas) for metadata include: </p>
      				
      <ul>
         					
         <li>
            							
            <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) scheme</a>
            						
         </li>
         					
         <li>
            							
            <a href="http://dublincore.org">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) terms for cross-disciplinary resources</a>
            						
         </li>
         					
         <li>
            							
            <a href="http://www.ieee.org/index.html">IEEE Standards</a>
            						
         </li>
         					
         				
      </ul>
      				
      <p>There are some tools available to provide resource descriptions, or  they can be provided
         manually. The more easily the metadata can be  created and collected at point of creation
         of a resource or at point of  publication, the more efficient the process and the
         more likely it is  to take place. 
      </p>
      				
      <p>Some examples include: </p>
