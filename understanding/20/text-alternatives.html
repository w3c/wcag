      <h2>Intent of Text Alternatives</h2>
      
      
      <p>The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that all non-text content is also available
         in 
         <a class="glossary">text</a>. "Text" refers to electronic text, not an image of text. Electronic text has the
         unique advantage that it is presentation neutral. That is, it
         can be rendered visually, auditorily, tactilely, or by any combination. As a result,
         information rendered in electronic text can be presented in whatever form best meets
         the needs of the user. It can also be easily enlarged, spoken aloud so that it is
         easier for people with reading disabilities to understand, or rendered in whatever
         tactile form best meets the needs of a user.

         <p>While changing the content into symbols includes changing it into graphic symbols
            for people with developmental disorders and speech comprehension difficulties, it
            is not limited to this use of symbols.

   <section><h3>Text alternatives and equivalents match the language of the content</h3>
      <p>Text alternatives and equivalents should match the human language of the original content (normally the default human language of the page). The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#conformance-reqs">5.2 Conformance Requirements</a> section, through the defined terms used there, states that success criteria be met through accessibility-supported ways (5.2.4), where the technology is used “in the human language of the content.” Where an alternative version is used (5.2.1), it is defined as something that “provides all of the same information and functionality in the same human language.”</p>
