      <h2>Intent of Reading Level</h2>
      
      
      <p>
         Content should be written as clearly and simply as possible. The intent of this Success
         Criterion is:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>to ensure that additional content is available to aid the understanding of difficult
            or complex text;
         </li>
         
         <li>to establish a testable measure indicating when such additional content is required.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>This success criterion helps people with reading disabilities while also allowing
         authors to publish difficult or complex web content. Text difficulty is described
         in terms of the level of education required to read the text. Education levels are
         defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education [[UNESCO]], which was created to allow international comparison among systems of education.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Difficult or complex text may be appropriate for most members of the intended audience
         (that is, most of the people for whom the content has been created). But there are
         people with disabilities, including reading disabilities, even among highly educated
         users with specialized knowledge of the subject matter. It may be possible to accommodate
         these users by making the text more readable. If the text cannot be made more readable,
         then supplemental content is needed. Supplemental content is required when text demands
         reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education levelâ€”that is, more
         than nine years of school. Such text presents severe obstacles to people with reading
         disabilities and is considered difficult even for people without disabilities who
         have completed upper secondary education.
      </p>
      
      <p>Reading disabilities such as dyslexia make it difficult to recognize written or printed
         words and associate them with the correct sounds. This is called "decoding" the text.
         Decoding must be automatic in order for people to read fluently. The act of decoding
         text word by word consumes much of the mental energy that most people are able to
         use for understanding what they read.
         Text that uses short, common words and short sentences is easier to decode and usually
         requires less advanced reading ability than text that uses long sentences and long
         or unfamiliar words.
      </p>
      
      <p>Educators can measure the education level required to read text content. For
         example, qualified teachers can evaluate text according to local education standards
         to determine if it requires reading ability beyond what is expected for students in
         the last year of lower secondary education.
      </p>
      
      <p>Because people's names, the names of cities or other proper names cannot be changed
         to shorter names with fewer syllables, and because doing so or just referring to everyone
         by pronouns can make sentences harder to understand, the success criterion specifies
         that proper names can be ignored or removed from the text before assessing whether
         it meets the reading ability requirement. Titles refer to the name of documents, books,
         movies, etc. Titles are removed or ignored for the analysis because changing the words
         in titles might make the titles easier to read but would make it impossible to understand
         the item to which the title refers. This would make it harder to read and understand
         the content. (e.g., a book, academic paper, article, etc.). Therefore, titles are
         also exempted specifically. 
      </p>
      
      <p>When a web page contains multiple languages, a readability result should be calculated
         for each language that constitutes at least 5% of the content and that is used in
         full sentences or paragraphs (not just individual words or phrases). The overall readability
         of the page should be judged on the language that yields the worst readability results.
      </p>

         <p>According to the Open Society Mental Health Initiative, the concept of Easy to Read
            cannot be universal, and it will not be possible to write a text that will suit the
            abilities of all people with literacy and comprehension problems. Using the clearest
            and simplest language appropriate is highly desirable, but the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group
            could not find a way to test whether this had been achieved. The use of reading level
            is a way to introduce testability into a success criterion that encourages clear writing.
            Supplementary content can be a powerful technique for people with some classes of
            cognitive disability.

      <ul>
         
         <li>Have difficulty comprehending and interpreting written language (e.g., articles, instructions,

      <h2>Examples of Reading Level</h2>
      
      <dl>
         <dt>A scientific journal including readable summaries of complex research articles</dt>
         <dd>A scientific journal includes articles written in highly technical language aimed
               at specialists in the field.  The journal's Table of Contents page includes a plain-language
               summary of each article. The summaries are intended for a general audience with eight
               years of school. The metadata for the journal uses the Dublin Core specification to
               identify the education level of the articles' intended audience as "advanced," and
               the education level of the intended audience for the summaries as "lower secondary
               education."</dd>
         <dt>Medical information for members of the public</dt>
         <dd>A medical school operates a website that explains recent medical and scientific discoveries.
               The articles on the site are written for people without medical training. Each article
               uses the Dublin Core metadata specification to identify the education level of the
               intended audience as "lower secondary education". A link on each page displays the education level and other
               metadata. No supplemental content is required because people who read at the lower
               secondary education level can read the articles.</dd>
         <dt>An e-learning application</dt>
         <dd>An on-line course about Spanish cultural history includes a unit on Moorish architecture.
               The unit includes text written for students with different reading abilities. Photographs
               and drawings of buildings illustrate architectural concepts and styles. Graphic organizers
               are used to illustrate complex relationships, and an audio version using synthetic
               speech is available. The metadata for each version describes the academic level of
               the content. The learning application uses this metadata and metadata about the students
               to provide versions of instructional content that match the needs of individual students.</dd>
