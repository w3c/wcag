      <h2>Intent of Enough Time</h2>
      
      
      <p>Many users who have disabilities need more time to complete tasks than the majority
         of users: they may take longer to physically respond, they may take longer to read
         things, they may have low vision and take longer to find things or to read them, or
         they may be accessing content through an assistive technology that requires more time.
         This guideline focuses on ensuring that users are able to complete the tasks required
         by the content with their own individual response times. The primary approaches deal
         with eliminating time constraints or providing users enough additional time to allow
         them to complete their tasks. Exceptions are provided for those cases where this is
         not possible.
