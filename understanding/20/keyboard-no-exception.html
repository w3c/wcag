      <h2>Intent of Keyboard (No Exception)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that
         <strong>all</strong> content is operable from the keyboard. This is the same as Success Criterion 2.1.1,
         except that no exceptions are allowed. This does not mean that content where the underlying
         function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just
         the endpoints (excluded from the requirements of 2.1.1) must be made keyboard accessible.
         Rather, it means that content that uses path-dependent input cannot conform to this
         success criterion and therefore cannot meet Guideline 2.1 at Level AAA.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
         <p>Platforms and user agents usually have conventions for how web content or
            applications are controlled with a keyboard interface. If content does not follow
            the platform/user agent conventions it may be difficult to use, as users will need
            to learn different interaction methods. As a <em>best practice</em>, content
            should follow the platform/user agent conventions. However, deviating from these
            conventions does <em>not</em> fail the normative requirement of this success criterion.</p>
         <p>
            For instance, buttons that have focus can generally be activated using both the
            <kbd>Enter</kbd> key and the <kbd>Space</kbd> bar. If a custom button control
            in a web application instead only reacts to <kbd>Enter</kbd>
            (or even a completely custom key or key combination), this still
            <strong>satisfies</strong> the requirements of this success criterion.
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="note">
         <p>This success criterion does not require that every visible control that can be activated
            using a pointer (such as a mouse or touch screen input) must also be focusable and actionable using the keyboard.
            The normative requirement is only that there must be a way for keyboard interface users to perform
            the same, or comparable, actions and to operate the content. Generally, the easiest way
            to achieve this is to provide controls that can be operated with all possible input devices;
            however, if a web application implements a separate mode of operation for keyboard interface users,
            it will <strong>not</strong> fail the success criterion.
