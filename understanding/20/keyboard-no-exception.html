      <h2>Intent of Keyboard (No Exception)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that 
         <strong>all</strong> content is operable from the keyboard. This is the same as Success Criterion 2.1.1,
         except that no exceptions are allowed. This does not mean that content where the underlying
         function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just
         the endpoints (excluded from the requirements of 2.1.1) must be made keyboard accessible.
         Rather, it means that content that uses path-dependent input cannot conform to this
         Success Criterion and therefore cannot meet Guideline 2.1 at Level AAA. 
      </p>

      <div class="note">
         <p>Platforms and user agents usually have conventions for how web content or applications
            are controlled with a keyboard interface. As a best practice, content should follow
            the platform/user agent conventions. However, deviating from these conventions does
            not fail the normative requirement of this success criterion. For instance, buttons
            that have focus can generally be activated using both the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key and
            the <kbd>Space</kbd> bar. If a custom button control in a web application instead only
            reacts to <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or even a completely custom key or key combination), this does <strong>not</strong> fail the success criterion.
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="note">
         <p>This success criterion does not require that every visible control that can be activated
            using a mouse or touch screen must also be focusable and actionable using the keyboard.
            The normative requirement is only that there must be a way for keyboard users to perform
            the same, or comparable, actions and to operate the content. Generally, the easiest way
            to achieve this is to provide controls that can be operated with all possible input devices;
            however, if a web application implements a completely separate mode of operation for keyboard
            users, it will <strong>not</strong> fail the success criterion.

            then it is not possible to meet this Level AAA Success Criterion.
