      <h2>Intent of Keyboard (No Exception)</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that 
         <strong>all</strong> content is operable from the keyboard. This is the same as Success Criterion 2.1.1,
         except that no exceptions are allowed. This does not mean that content where the underlying
         function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just
         the endpoints (excluded from the requirements of 2.1.1) must be made keyboard accessible.
         Rather, it means that content that uses path-dependent input cannot conform to this
         Success Criterion and therefore cannot meet Guideline 2.1 at Level AAA.

         <h3>Sufficient Techniques for Keyboard (No Exception)</h3>
         
         
         <p>No additional techniques exist for this Success Criterion. Follow 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable">techniques for Success Criterion 2.1.1</a>. If that is not possible because there is a requirement for path-dependent input,
            then it is not possible to meet this Level AAA Success Criterion.
