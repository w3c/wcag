      <h2>Benefits of Location</h2>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>This success criterion is helpful for people with a short attention span who may become
            confused when following a long series of navigation steps to a web page. It is also
            helpful when a user follows a link directly to a page deep within a set of web pages
            and needs to navigate that website to understand the content of that page or to find
            more related information.

         <dt>A breadcrumb trail</dt>
         <dd>A portal website organizes topics into categories. As the user navigates through
               categories and subcategories, a breadcrumb trail shows the current location in the
               hierarchy of categories. Each page also contains a link to the portal home page.</dd>
