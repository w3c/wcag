      <h2>Intent of Name, Role, Value</h2>
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that Assistive Technologies (AT)
         can gather appropriate information about, activate (or set) and keep up to date on the status of
         user interface controls in the content.
      </p>
      <p>When standard controls from accessible technologies are used, this process is straightforward.
         If the user interface elements are used according to specification the conditions
         of this provision will be met. (See examples of Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value below)
      </p>
      <p>If custom controls are created, however, or interface elements are programmed (in
         code or script) to have a different role and/or function than usual, then additional
         measures need to be taken to ensure that the controls provide important and appropriate information
         to assistive technologies and allow themselves to be controlled by assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <p>What roles and states are appropriate to convey to assistive technology will depend
         on what the control represents. Specifics about such information are defined by other
         specifications, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">WAI-ARIA</a>, or the
         relevant platform standards. Another factor to consider is whether there is sufficient
         <a>accessibility support</a> with assistive technologies to convey the information as specified.
      </p>
      <p>A particularly important state of a user interface control is whether or not it has
         focus. The focus state of a control can be programmatically determined, and notifications
         about change of focus are sent to user agents and assistive technology. Other examples
         of user interface control states are whether or not a checkbox or radio button has
         been selected, or whether a collapsible tree view or accordion is expanded or collapsed.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
         <p>Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value requires a programmatically determinable name for all user
            interface components. Names may be visible or invisible. Occasionally, the name needs
            to be visible, in which case it is identified as a label. Refer to the definition of
            name and label in the glossary for more information.

      <h2>Benefits of Name, Role, Value</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Providing role, state, and value information on all user interface components enables
            compatibility with assistive technology, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers,
            and speech recognition software, used by people with disabilities.
