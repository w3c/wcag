      <h2>Intent of Section Headings</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide headings for sections of a Web
         page, when the page is organized into sections. For instance, long documents are often
         divided into a variety of chapters, chapters have subtopics and subtopics are divided
         into various sections, sections into paragraphs, etc. When such sections exist, they
         need to have headings that introduce them. This clearly indicates the organization
         of the content, facilitates navigation within the content, and provides mental "handles"
         that aid in comprehension of the content. Other page elements may complement headings
         to improve presentation (e.g., horizontal rules and boxes), but visual presentation
         is not sufficient to identify document sections.
      </p>
      
      <p>This provision is included at Level AAA because it cannot be applied to all types
         of content and it may not always be possible to insert headings. For example, when
         posting a pre-existing document to the Web, headings that an author did not include
         in the original document cannot be inserted. Or, a long letter would often cover different
         topics, but putting headings into a letter would be very strange. However, if a document
         can be broken up into sections with headings, it facilitates both understanding and
         navigation.
      </p>

         <ul>
            
            <li>People who are blind will know when they have moved from one section of a Web page
               to another and will know the purpose of each section.
            </li>
            
            <li>People with some learning disabilities will be able to use the headings to understand
               the overall organization of the page content more easily.
            </li>
            
            <li>People who navigate content by keyboard will be able to jump the focus from heading
               to heading, enabling them to find quickly content of interest.
            </li>
            
            <li>In pages where content in part of the page updates, headings can be used to quickly
               access updated content.

         <li>A Web application contains a settings page that is divided into groups of related
