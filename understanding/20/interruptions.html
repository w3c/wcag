      <h2>Intent of Interruptions</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to turn off updates from the
         author/server except in emergencies. Emergencies would include civil emergency alert
         messages or any other messages that warn of danger to health, safety, or property,
         including data loss, loss of connection, etcetera.
      </p>
      
      <p>This allows access by people with cognitive limitations or attention disorders by
         enabling them to focus on the content. It also allows users who are blind or have
         low vision to keep their "viewing" focus on the content they are currently reading.

      <ul>
         
         <li>Individuals with attention deficit disorders can focus on content without distraction.</li>
         
         <li>Individuals with low vision or who use screen readers will not have content updated
            while they are viewing it (which can lead to discontinuity and misunderstanding if
            they start reading in one topic and finish in another).
