      <h2>Intent of Re-authenticating</h2>

      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to allow all users to complete authenticated
         transactions that have inactivity time limits or other circumstances that would cause
         a user to be logged out while in the midst of completing the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>For security reasons, many sites implement an authentication time limit after a certain
         period of inactivity. These time limits may cause problems for persons with disabilities
         because it may take longer for them to complete the activity.
      </p>
      <p>Other sites will log a person out of a session if a person logs in on the website
         from another computer or if other activities arise that make the site suspicious of
         whether the person is still the same legitimate person who logged in originally. When
         users are logged out while still in the midst of a transaction - it is important that
         they be given the ability to re-authenticate and continue with the transaction without
         the loss of any data already entered.
      </p>
      <p class="note">Sites that implement session time limits and re-authentication requests are
         still subject to the requirements of other criteria, such as
         <a href="timing-adjustable">2.2.1 Timing Adjustable</a>.

      <h2>Benefits of Re-authenticating</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>This success criterion benefits people who may require additional time to complete
            an activity. People with cognitive limitations may read slowly and require additional
            time to read and respond to a questionnaire. Users interacting via a screen reader
            may need extra time to navigate and complete a complicated form.
            A person with motor impairments or who navigates with an alternative input device
            may require additional time to navigate through or complete input within a form.
         </li>
         <li>In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating audio content to
            a user who is deaf, control over time limits is also important.
         </li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Re-authenticating</h2>

      <dl>
         <dt>A shopping site checkout</dt>
         <dd>A user is logged into a shopping site. While in the middle of the checkout process, the user
               is interrupted and has to leave their computer. While they are away, the site prompts the user
               that the process is about to time out, and offers the ability to extend the timeout â€“ but with
               the user away, the timeout is not extended and the user is logged out. When the user returns to
               the computer, they have to re-authenticate.
               After the user logs in, the check out process is restored with the same information
               and at the same stage. The user did not lose any data because the server had temporarily
               accepted and stored the submission even though the session had timed out and restored
               the user to the same state after re-authentication was completed.</dd>
         <dt>Authentication in an email program</dt>
         <dd>An email program has an authentication time-out after 30 minutes. The program prompts
               the user several minutes before the time-out occurs and provides a link to open a
               new window in order to re-authenticate. The original window with the in-progress email
               remains intact and, after re-authentication, the user may send that data.</dd>
