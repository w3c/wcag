			<h2>Intent of No Keyboard Trap</h2>


			<p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that that content does not “trap” the
				keyboard focus within subsections of content on a web page or app. It is common to restrict
				the focus to a specific dialog or popover. It can also occur if content is rendered using
				plug-ins or when content is embedded.
			</p>

			<p>As long as the user knows how to leave a subsection of content (and “untrap” the focus),
				a web page can restrict the focus to a subsection of the content. In some cases, temporarily
				restricting the focus to a specific component is useful to help users understand where they
				are on the page and what interactions are possible. It also prevents the focus from being
				obscured, for example behind a dialog.
			</p>

			<p>The keyboard focus is not considered as trapped when the user can navigate away from a UI
				component using the unmodified tab or arrow keys or when another “standard exit method” exists.
				What is a “standard exit method” depends on the user’s hardware and software. A press
				of the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key is such a “standard exit method”. When the press of the hardware back
				button on certain mobile operating systems “untraps” the keyboard focus is also sufficient.
				In addition, some screen readers have other ways, like swipe gestures, that result in a
				pressed <kbd>ESC</kbd> key.

			<h2>Examples of No Keyboard Trap</h2>

			<dl>
				<dt>A modal dialog box</dt>
				<dd>A web application brings up a dialog box. At the bottom of the dialog are two buttons,
					Cancel and OK. When the dialog has been opened, focus is trapped within the dialog;
					tabbing from the last control in the dialog takes focus to the first control in the
					dialog. The dialog is dismissed by activating the Cancel button, the OK button, or the
					<kbd>ESC</kbd> key.
				<dt>A calendar widget</dt>
				<dd>A calendar widget allows users to add, remove or update items in their calendar using
					the keyboard. The controls in the widget are part of the tab order within the Web
					page, allowing users to tab through the controls in the widget as well as to any links
					or controls that follow.</dd>
				<dt>A puzzle applet</dt>
				<dd>Once a user tabs into an applet, further tabs and other keystrokes are handled by
					the applet. Instructions describing the keystroke used to exit the applet are provided
					prior to the applet as well as within the applet itself.</dd>
				</dd>
