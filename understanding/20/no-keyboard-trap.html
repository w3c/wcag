      <h2>Intent of No Keyboard Trap</h2>
      
      <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that that content does not "trap"
         keyboard focus within subsections of content on a web page. This is a common problem
         when multiple formats are combined within a page and rendered using plug-ins or embedded
         applications, or when custom components and widgets are not implemented with keyboard users
         in mind.</p>
      
      <p>There may be times when it's appropriate for a web page to restrict focus to a subsection
         of the content – for example, when the user is inside a modal dialog or popover. This does
         not fail the requirements of this criterion, as long as the user knows how to "untrap" the focus
         and leave that component.</p>

      <p>Keyboard focus is not considered trapped when the user can navigate away from a component
         using only a keyboard interface, and if it only requires unmodified arrow or <kbd>Tab</kbd> keys
         or other "standard exit methods". This specification does not define what constitutes a
         "standard exit method" – this is dependent on the user's hardware, user agent, and operating system,
         and as such will require some interpretation from authors and auditors. Generally, in most
         environments with a physical keyboard, pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key is a commonly
         used "standard exit method", but other platform-specific methods may be available.</p>

      <p>If untrapping focus requires a different method (rather than unmodified arrow or <kbd>Tab</kbd> keys or
         other "standard exit methods"), content can still pass this criterion provided that the user is
         advised how they can untrap focus using their keyboard interface.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of No Keyboard Trap</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>People who rely on a keyboard or keyboard interface to use the web including people
            who are blind and people with physical disabilities.

      <h2>Examples of No Keyboard Trap</h2>
      
      <dl>
         <dt>A modal dialog box</dt>
         <dd>A web application opens a dialog box. At the bottom of the dialog are two buttons,
					"Cancel" and "OK". When the dialog is open, focus is trapped within the dialog –
					tabbing from the last control in the dialog takes focus to the first control in the
					dialog. The dialog is dismissed by activating the "Cancel" button, the "OK" button,
               or the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.</dd>
         <dt>A calendar widget</dt>
         <dd>A calendar widget allows users to add, remove or update items in their calendar using
               the keyboard. The controls in the widget are part of the tab order within the web
               page, allowing users to tab through the controls in the widget as well as to any links
               or controls that follow.</dd>
         <dt>A puzzle applet</dt>
         <dd>Once a user tabs into an applet, further tabs and other keystrokes are handled by
               the applet. Instructions describing the keystroke used to exit the applet are provided
               prior to the applet as well as within the applet itself.</dd>
