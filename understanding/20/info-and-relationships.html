   <h1>Understanding Info and Relationships</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Info and Relationships</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that information and relationships
         that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation
         format changes. For example, the presentation format changes when the content is read
         by a screen reader or when a user style sheet is substituted for the style sheet provided
         by the author.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         						Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues
         — headings are often in a larger, bold font separated from paragraphs by blank lines;
         list items are preceded by a bullet and perhaps indented; paragraphs are separated
         by a blank line; items that share a common characteristic are organized into tabular
         rows and columns; form fields may be positioned as groups that share text labels;
         a different background color may be used to indicate that several items are related
         to each other; words that have special status are indicated by changing the font family
         and /or bolding, italicizing, or underlining them; items that share a common characteristic
         are organized into a table where the relationship of cells sharing the same row or
         column and the relationship of each cell to its row and/or column header are necessary
         for understanding; and so on. Having these structures and these relationships programmatically
         determined or available in text ensures that information important for comprehension
         will be perceivable to all.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Auditory cues may be used as well. For example, a chime might indicate the beginning
         of a new section; a change in voice pitch or speech rate may be used to emphasize
         important information or to indicate quoted text; etc.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         When such relationships are perceivable to one set of users, those relationships can
         be made to be perceivable to all. One method of determining whether or not information
         has been properly provided to all users is to access the information serially in different
         modalities.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>If links to glossary items are implemented using anchor elements (or the proper link
         element for the technology in use) and identified using a different font face, a screen
         reader user will hear that the item is a link when the glossary term is encountered
         even though they may not receive information about the change in font face. An on-line
         catalog may indicate prices using a larger font colored red. A screen reader or person
         who cannot perceive red, still has the information about the price as long as it is
         preceded by the currency symbol.
      </p>
      
      <p>Some technologies do not provide a means to programmatically determine some types
         of information and relationships. In that case then there should be a text description
         of the information and relationships. For instance, "all required fields are marked
         with an asterisk (*)". The text description should be near the information it is describing
         (when the page is linearized), such as in the parent element or in the adjacent element.
      </p>
      
      <p>There may also be cases where it may be a judgment call as to whether the relationships
         should be programmatically determined or be presented in text. However, when technologies
         support programmatic relationships, it is strongly encouraged that information and
         relationships be programmatically determined rather than described in text.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>It is not required that color values be programmatically determined. The information
            conveyed by color cannot be adequately presented simply by exposing the value. Therefore,
            
            <a href="use-of-color" class="guideline">Success Criterion 1.4.1

      <ul>
         
         <li>This Success Criterion helps people with different disabilities by allowing user agents
            to adapt content according to the needs of individual users.
            
         </li>
         
         <li>Users who are blind (using a screen reader) benefit when information conveyed through
            color is also available in text (including text alternatives for images that use color
            to convey information).
         </li>
         
         <li>Users who are deaf-blind using braille (text) refreshable displays may be unable to
            access color-dependent information.

               A form contains several required fields. The labels for the required fields are displayed
               in red. In addition, at the end of each label is an asterisk character, *. The instructions
               for completing the form indicate that "all required fields are displayed in red and
               marked with an asterisk *", followed by an example.

            <p>A form contains both required and optional fields. Instructions at the top of the
               form explain that required fields are labeled with red text and also with an icon
               whose text alternative says, "Required." Both the red text and the icon are programmatically
               associated with the appropriate form fields so that assistive technology users can
               determine the required fields.

            <p>A bus schedule consists of a table with the bus stops listed vertically in the first
               column and the different buses listed horizontally across the first row. Each cell
               contains the time when the bus will be at that bus stop. The bus stop and bus cells
               are identified as headers for their corresponding row or column so that assistive
               technology can programmatically determine which bus and which bus stop are associated
               with the time in each cell.
