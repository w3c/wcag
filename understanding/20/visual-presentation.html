      <h2>Intent of Visual Presentation</h2>
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that visually  rendered text is
         presented in such a manner that it can be perceived  without its layout interfering
         with its readability. People with some  cognitive, language and learning disabilities
         and some low vision users  cannot perceive the text and/or lose their reading place
         if the text is presented in a  manner that is difficult for them to read. 
      </p>
      
      <p>People with some visual or cognitive disabilities need to be  able to select the color
         of text and the color of the background. They  sometimes choose combinations that
         seem unintuitive to someone without  that disability. Sometimes these combinations
         have very low contrast.  Sometimes only very specific color combinations work for
         them. Control of color or other aspects of text presentation makes a huge difference
         to their comprehension.  
      </p>
      
      <p>For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long  lines of text can become
         a significant barrier. They have trouble  keeping their place and following the flow
         of text. Having a narrow  block of text makes it easier for them to continue on to
         the next line  in a block. Lines should not exceed 80 characters or glyphs (40 if
         CJK), where glyphs are the element of writing in the writing system for the text. Studies
         have shown that Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) characters are approximately twice
         as wide as non-CJK characters when both types of characters are displayed with characteristics
         that achieve the same readability, so the maximum line width for CJK characters is
         half that of non-CJK characters.
      </p>
      
      <p>People with some cognitive disabilities find it difficult to track text where the
         lines are close together. Providing extra space between lines and paragraphs allows
         them to better track the next line and to recognize when they have reached the end
         of a paragraph. It is best if there are several different options, for instance, space-and-a-half
         and double spacing for line spacing. By space and a half within paragraphs we mean
         that top of one line is 150% further from the top of the line below it than would
         be true when the text is 'single spaced' (the default spacing for the font). By Paragraph
         spacing that is 1.5 times larger than the line spacing we mean that the spacing from
         the top of the last line of 1 paragraph is 250% farther from the Top of the first
         line of the next paragraph (i.e., that there is a blank line between the two paragraphs
         that is 150% of the single space blank line). 
      </p>
      
      <p>People with certain cognitive disabilities have problems  reading text that is both
         left and right justified. The uneven spacing  between words in fully justified text
         can cause "rivers of white" space  to run down the page making reading difficult and
         in some cases  impossible. Text justification can also cause words to be spaced  closely
         together, so that it is difficult for them to locate word  boundaries. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The resizing provision ensures that visually rendered text, including
         controls and labels using text, can be made larger without requiring the user to then
         scroll left and right to see all of the content. When the content has been authored
         so that this is possible, the content is said to reflow. This permits people with
         low vision and people with cognitive disabilities to increase the size of the text
         without becoming disoriented. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The scaling of content is primarily a user agent  responsibility. User agents that
         satisfy UAAG 1.0 Checkpoint 4.1 allow  users to configure text scale. The author's
         responsibility is to create  Web content that does not prevent the user agent from
         scaling the  content and that allows the reflow of the content within the current
         width of the viewport. See 
         <a href="resize-text">1.4.4: Resize Text</a> for additional discussion of resizing text. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The horizontal scrolling requirement is not intended to apply to small-screen devices
         where long words may be displayed on a single line and require users to scroll horizontally.
         For the purposes of this requirement, authors should ensure that content meets this
         requirement on standard desktop/laptop displays with the browser window maximized.
         Since people generally keep their computers for several years, it is best not to rely
         on the latest desktop/laptop display resolutions but to consider the common desktop/laptop
         display resolutions over the course of several years when making this evaluation.
      </p>
      
      <p>Wrapping should always be possible as long as words are not so long that a single
         word is more than half the width of a full screen. Very long URIs may run off the side of an enlarged screen, but they would not be considered text
         for "reading" and, therefore, would not violate this provision.
      </p>
      
      <p>This provision does not mean that a user would never need to use horizontal scrolling.
         It only means that they would not need to use horizontal scrolling back and forth
         to read a line of text. For example, if a page consisted of two equal sized columns
         of text, it would automatically meet this provision. Enlarging the page would mean
         that the first column was completely on screen and the user could just scroll vertically
         down the page to read it. To read the second column, they would horizontally scroll
         to the right, where the right hand column would then fit entirely within the width
         of the screen, and read that column without further horizontal scrolling.

      <h2>Benefits of Visual Presentation</h2>

      <p>This Success Criterion helps low vision users by letting them see  text without distracting
         presentational features. It lets them  configure text in ways that will be easier
         for them to see by letting  them control the color and size of blocks of text. 
      </p>
      
      <p>This Success Criterion helps people with cognitive, language  and learning disabilities
         perceive text and track their location within  blocks of text. 
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         <li>People with some cognitive disabilities can read text better when they select their
            own foreground and background color combinations. 
         </li>
         <li>People with some cognitive disabilities can track their  locations more easily when
            blocks of text are narrow and when they can  configure the amount of space between
            lines and paragraphs. 
         </li>
         <li>People with some cognitive disabilities can read text more easily when the spacing
            between words is regular. 
         </li>
