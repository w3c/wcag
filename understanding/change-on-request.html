            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage design of Web content that gives
               users full control of changes of context. 
               This Success Criterion aims to eliminate potential confusion that may be caused by
               unexpected changes of context such as automatic launching of new windows, automatic
               submission of forms after selecting an item from a list, etcetera. 
               Such unexpected changes of context may cause difficulties for people with motor impairments,
               people with low vision, people who are blind, and people with certain cognitive limitations.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Some types of change of context are not disruptive to some users, or actively benefit
               some users. For example, single-switch users rely on context changes that are animated
               by the system, and the preferences of low-vision users may vary depending on how much
               of the content they can see at once and how much of the session structure they can
               retain in working memory. Some types of content, such as slide shows, require the
               ability to change context in order to provide the intended user experience. Content
               that initiates changes of context automatically only when user preferences allow can
               conform to this Success Criterion.
               
               
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  
                  <p>It is possible for more than one change of context to occur simultaneously. For example,
                     clicking on a link which automatically opens a new window is an example of two separate
                     changes of context related to the change in content and to the change in the viewport
                     (window). The change in the content in this case is initiated by user request when
                     they click on the link, but unless the user can be aware that the link will open in
                     a new window then that change of context cannot be regarded as user-initiated.

                     context has changed are less likely to become disoriented while navigating a site.
                     For example:
                     
                  </p>

                     <li>individuals who are blind or have low vision may have difficulty knowing when a visual
                        context change has occurred, such as a new window popping up. In this case, warning
                        users of context changes in advance minimizes confusion when the user discovers that
                        the back button no longer behaves as expected.
