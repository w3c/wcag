<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>


			<p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that user interface components (i.e., controls) and meaningful graphics are distinguishable by people with moderately low vision. The requirements and rationale are similar to those for large text in <a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>. Note that this requirement does not apply to <em>inactive</em> user interface components.</p>

			<p>Low contrast controls are more difficult to perceive, and may be completely missed by people with a visual impairment. Similarly, if a graphic is needed to understand the content or functionality of the web page then it should be perceivable by people with low vision or other impairments without the need for contrast-enhancing assistive technology.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p class="note-title marker">Note</p>
				<div>
				<p>The 3:1 contrast ratios referenced in this success criterion is intended to be treated as threshold values. When comparing the computed contrast ratio to the success criterion ratio, the computed values should not be rounded (e.g. 2.999:1 would not meet the 3:1 threshold).</p>
			</div>
			</div>

			<div class="note">
				<p class="note-title marker">Note</p>
				<div>
				<p>Because authors do not have control over user settings for font smoothing and anti-aliasing, when evaluating this
					 Success Criterion, refer to the colors obtained from the user agent, or the underlying
					 markup and stylesheets, rather than the non-text elements as presented on screen.</p>
				<p>Due to anti-aliasing, particularly thin lines and shapes of non-text elements may be rendered by user agents with
					 a much fainter color than the actual color defined in the underlying CSS. This can lead to situations where
					 non-text elements have a contrast ratio that nominally passes the Success Criterion, but have a much lower contrast
					 in practice. In these cases, best practice would be for authors to avoid particularly thin lines and shapes,
					 or to use a combination of colors that exceeds the normative requirements of this success criterion.
				</p>

				<h3>User Interface Components</h3>

				<p>Unless the control is <em>inactive</em>, any visual information provided that is necessary for a user to identify that a control is present and how to operate it must have a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with the adjacent colors. Also, any visual information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.</p>

				<p>This success criterion does not require that changes in color that differentiate between states of an individual component meet the 3:1 contrast ratio when they do not appear next to each other. For example, there is not a new requirement that visited links contrast with the default color, or that mouse hover indicators contrast with the default state. However, the component must not lose contrast with the adjacent colors, and non-text indicators such as the check in a checkbox, or an arrow graphic indicating a menu is selected or open must have sufficient contrast to the adjacent colors.</p>

				<h4 id="boundaries">Boundaries</h4>

				<p>This success criterion does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast. If text (or an icon) within a button or placeholder text inside a text input is visible and there is no visual indication of the hit area then the success criterion is passed. If a button with text also has a colored border, since the border does not provide the only indication there is no contrast requirement beyond the text contrast (<a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>). Note that for people with cognitive disabilities it is recommended to delineate the boundary of controls to aid in the recognition of controls and therefore the completion of activities.</p>

				<figure id="figure-buttons-no-visual-indicator">
						<img alt="Two buttons, the first with no visual indicator except text saying 'button'. The second is the same but with an added grey border." src="img/minimal-button.png"> 
						<figcaption><p><span>Figure 1.</span> <strong>Pass:</strong> A button without a visual boundary, and the same button with a focus indicator that is a defined visual boundary of grey (<code>#949494</code>) adjacent to white.</p></figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h4 id="adjacent-colors">Adjacent colors</h4>
				<p>For user interface components 'adjacent colors' means the colors adjacent to the component. For example, if an input has a white internal background, dark border, and white external background the 'adjacent color' to the component would be the white external background.</p>
				<figure id="figure-standard-text-adjacent-white">
					<img src="img/text-input-default.png" alt="Standard text input with a label, white internal and external background with a dark border.">
					<figcaption><p><span>Figure 2.</span> <strong>Pass:</strong> A standard text input with a grey border (<code>#767676</code>) and white adjacent color outside the component</p></figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>If components use several colors, any color which does not interfere with identifying the component can be ignored for the purpose of measuring contrast ratio. For example, a 3D drop-shadow on an input, or a dark border line between contrasting backgrounds is considered to be subsumed into the color closest in brightness (perceived luminance).</p>

				<p>The following example shows an input that has a light background on the inside and a dark background around it. The input also has a dark grey border which is considered to be subsumed into the dark background. The border does not interfere with identifying the component, so the contrast ratio is taken between the white background and dark blue background.</p>

				<figure id="figure-text-box-dark-bg-light-border">
					<img alt="A text box with a dark background and light border, with a white background." src="img/text-input-background-border.png">
					<figcaption><p><span>Figure 3.</span> <strong>Pass:</strong> The contrast of the input background (white) and color adjacent to the control (dark blue <code>#003366</code>) is sufficient. There is also a border (silver) on the component that is not required to contrast with either.</p></figcaption>

				<h4 id="related-color">Relationship with Use of Color</h4>

				<p>The <a href="use-of-color">Use of Color</a> success criterion addresses changing <strong>only the color</strong> (hue) of an object or text without otherwise altering the object's form. The principle is that contrast ratio (the difference in brightness) can be used to distinguish text or graphics. For example, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/general/G183">G183: Using a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text and providing additional visual cues on hover for links or controls where color alone is used to identify them</a> is a technique to use a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text to distinguish links and controls. In that case the Working Group regards a link color that meets the 3:1 contrast ratio relative to the non-linked text color as satisfying the Success Criterion <a href="use-of-color">1.4.1 Use of color</a> since it is relying on contrast ratio as well as color (hue) to convey that the text is a link.</p>

				<p>Non-text information within controls that uses a change of hue alone to convey the value or state of an input, such as a 1-5 star indicator with a black outline for each star filled with either yellow (full) or white (empty) is likely to fail the Use of color criterion rather than this one.</p>

				<figure id="figure-two-star-ratings">
					<img src="img/star-examples-pass.png" alt="Two star ratings, one uses a black outline (on white) with a black fill to indicate it is checked. The second has a yellow fill and a thicker dark border." width="300">
					<figcaption><p><span>Figure 6.</span> <strong>Pass:</strong> Two examples which pass this success criterion, using either a solid fill to indicate a checked-state that has contrast, or a thicker border as well as yellow fill.

				<figure id="figure-two-star-ratings-failing">
					<img src="img/star-examples-fail.png" alt="Two star ratings, the first uses 5 stars with a black outline and a yellow or white fill, where yellow indicates checked. The second uses only pale yellow stars on white." width="300">
					<figcaption><p><span>Figure 7.</span> <strong>Fail:</strong> The first example fails the Use of color criterion due to relying on yellow and white hues. The second example fails the Non-text contrast criterion due to the yellow (<code>#FFF000</code>) to white contrast ratio of 1.2:1.
					</p></figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Using a change of contrast for focus and other states is a technique to differentiate the states. This is the basis for <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/general/G195">G195: Using an author-supplied, visible focus indicator</a>, and more techniques are being added.</p>


				<h4 id="related-focus">Relationship with Focus Visible</h4>

				<p>In combination with <a href="focus-visible" class="sc">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a>, the visual focus indicator for a component <em>must</em> have sufficient contrast against the adjacent background when the component is focused, except where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.</p>

				<p>Most focus indicators appear outside the component - in that case it needs to contrast with the background that the component is on. Other cases include focus indicators which are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>only inside the component and need to contrast with the adjacent color(s) within the component.</li>
					<li>the border of the component (inside the component and adjacent to the outside) and need to contrast with both adjacent colours. </li>
					<li>partly inside and partly outside, where either part of the focus indicator can contrast with the adjacent colors.</li>
				</ul>

					<figcaption><p><span>Figure 10.</span> 
						<strong>Pass:</strong> The external green indicator (<code>#008000</code>) does contrast with the white background (<code>#FFF</code>) which the component is on. It does not need to contrast with both the component background and the component, as visually the effect is that the button is noticeably larger, and it's not necessary for a user to be able to discern this extra border in isolation. Although this passes non-text contrast, it is not a good indicator unless it is very thick. <span class="wcag22"><span class="new-version">New in WCAG 2.2: </span>There is a AAA criterion in WCAG 2.2 that addresses this aspect, <a href="focus-appearance.html">Focus Appearance</a></span>.

				</figure>

				<p>If an indicator is partly inside and partly outside the component, either part of the indicator could provide contrast.</p>

				<figure id="figure-focus-outer-inner">

					</p></figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>If the focus indicator changes the border of the component within the visible boundary it must contrast with the component. Typically an outline goes around (outside) the visible boundary of the component, in this case changing the border is just inside the visible edge of the component.</p>

				<figure id="figure-focus-border">

				<figure id="figure-focus-inner-green">

				</figure>

		        <p>Note that this success criterion does not directly compare the focused and unfocused states of a control - if the focus state relies on a change of color (e.g., changing <em>only</em> the background color of a button), this success criterion does not define any requirement for the difference in contrast between the two states.</p>

				<section id="hover-states">
					<h3>Hover states</h3>
					<p>The language of Non-text Contrast specifically calls out "visual information required to identify...states." When users talk about a hover state, they are normally referring to a visual effect that takes place when the pointer is positioned over a control. However, there are a number of HTML components (such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and selects) which do not by default display any additional visual effects when the user moves a pointer control over them. The pointer itself, via its location, is the indicator of whether the user is hovering on a component. Therefore, additional author-supplied visual treatments for hover are not "required to identify" the hover state. Those treatments can be considered supplemental and do not themselves need to contrast 3:1 against the background.</p>
					
					<p>This is not to say that other hover effects are discouraged. For instance, some native components alter the shape of the pointer when it is hovering over a control; the pointer becomes an I-beam when it hovers over text inputs and text areas. There will be cases where some users may benefit from additional visual hover effects, such as bolding text or use of drop shadows. However, other users may find strong hover effects distracting. The key consideration for any hover effect is that it does not cause a component itself to lose sufficient contrast against adjacent colors, or cause the visual indicators for other states, such as focus or selection, to lose sufficient contrast.</p>

					<h4>Inactive User Interface Components</h4>

					<p>User Interface Components that are not available for user interaction (e.g., a disabled control in HTML) are not required to meet contrast requirements. An inactive user interface component is visible but not currently operable.

					</figure>
					<p>Inactive components, such as disabled controls in HTML, are not available for user interaction. The decision to exempt inactive controls from the contrast requirements was based on a number of considerations. Although it would be beneficial to some people to discern inactive controls, a one-size-fits-all solution has been very difficult to establish. A method of varying the presentation of disabled controls, such as adding an icon for disabled controls, based on user preferences is anticipated as an advancement in the future.</p>

				<h3>Graphical Objects</h3>


				<p>The term "graphical object" applies to stand-alone icons such as a print icon (with no text), and the important parts of a more complex diagram such as each line in a graph. For simple graphics such as single-color icons the entire image is a graphical object. Images made up of multiple lines, colors and shapes will be made of multiple graphical objects, some of which are required for understanding.</p>

				<p>Not every graphical object needs to contrast with its surroundings - only those that are required for a user to understand what the graphic is conveying. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Pr.C3.A4gnanz">Gestalt principles</a> such as the "law of continuity" can be used to ignore minor overlaps with other graphical objects or colors.</p>

				<p>Taking the magnet image above as an example, the process for establishing the graphical object(s) is to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Assess what part of each image is needed to understand what it represents.<br>
						The magnet's "U" shape can be conveyed by the outline or by the red background (either is acceptable). The white tips are also important (otherwise it would be a horseshoe), which needs to contrast with the red background.</li>
					<li>Assume that the user could only see those aspects. Do they contrast with the adjacent colors?<br>
						The outline of the magnet contrasts with the surrounding text (black/white), and the red and white between the tips also has sufficient contrast.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Due to the strong contrast of the red and white, it would also be possible to only put the outline around the white tips of the magnet and it would still conform.</p>

				<section id="required-for-understanding">
				<h4>Required for Understanding</h4>

				<p>The term "required for understanding" is used in the success criterion as many graphics do not need to meet the contrast requirements. If a person needs to perceive a graphic, or part of a graphic (a graphical object) in order to understand the content it should have sufficient contrast. However, that is not a requirement when:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>A graphic with text embedded or overlaid conveys the same information, such as labels <em>and</em> values on a chart.</p>
						<div class="note">
				<p class="note-title marker">Note</p>
				<p>Text within a graphic must meet <a href="contrast-minimum" class="sc">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>.</p>
			</div>
					</li>
					<li> The graphic is for aesthetic purposes that does not require the user to see or understand it to understand the content or use the functionality.</li>
					<li> The information is available in another form, such as in a table that follows the graph, which becomes visible when a "Long Description" button is pressed.</li>
					<li> The graphic is part of a logo or brand name (which is considered "essential" to its presentation).</li>
				</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="gradients">
				<h4>Gradients</h4>

				<p>Gradients can reduce the apparent contrast between areas, and make it more difficult to test. The general principles is to identify the graphical object(s) required for understanding, and take the central color of that area. If you remove the adjacent color which does not have sufficient contrast, can you still identify and understand the graphical object?</p>

				<h4>Dynamic Examples</h4>

				<p>Some graphics may have interactions that either vary the contrast, or display the information as text when you mouseover/tap/focus each graphical object. In order for someone to discern the graphics exist at all, the unfocused default version must already have sufficiently contrasting colors or text. For the area that receives focus, information can then be made available dynamically as pop-up text, or be foregrounded dynamically by increasing the contrast.</p>

				<section id="infographics">
				<h4>Infographics</h4>

				<p>Infographics can mean any graphic conveying data, such as a chart or diagram. On the web it is often used to indicate a large graphic with lots of statements, pictures, charts or other ways of conveying data. In the context of graphics contrast, each item within such an infographic should be treated as a set of graphical objects, regardless of whether it is in one file or separate files.</p>

				<p>Infographics often fail to meet several WCAG level AA criteria including:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="non-text-content" class="sc">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a></li>
					<li><a href="use-of-color" class="sc">1.4.1 Use of Color</a></li>
					<li><a href="contrast-minimum" class="sc">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a></li>
					<li><a href="images-of-text" class="sc">1.4.5 Images of Text</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>An infographic can use text which meets the other criteria to minimise the number of graphical objects required for understanding. For example, using text with sufficient contrast to provide the values in a chart. A long description would also be sufficient because then the infographic is not relied upon for understanding.</p>

					<h4>Essential Exception</h4>

					<p>Graphical objects do not have to meet the contrast requirements when "a particular presentation of graphics is essential to the information being conveyed". The Essential exception is intended to apply when there is no way of presenting the graphic with sufficient contrast without undermining the meaning. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Logotypes and flags</strong>: The brand logo of an organization or product is the representation of that organization and therefore exempt. Flags may not be identifiable if the colors are changed to have sufficient contrast.</li>
						<li><strong>Sensory</strong>: There is no requirement to change pictures of real life scenes such as photos of people or scenery.</li>
						<li><strong>Representing other things</strong>: If you cannot represent the graphic in any other way, it is essential. Examples include: 
							<ul>
								<li>Screenshots to demonstrate how a website appeared.</li>
								<li>Diagrams of medical information that use the colors found in biology (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye_it.svg">example medical schematic from Wikipedia</a>).</li>
								<li>color gradients that represent a measurement, such as heat maps (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eyetracking_heat_map_Wikipedia.jpg">example heatmap from Wikipedia</a>).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

			<section id="testing-principles">
					<h3>Testing Principles</h3>
					<p>A summary of the high-level process for finding and assessing non-text content on a web page:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Identify each user-interface component (link, button, form control) on the page and:
							<ul>
								<li>Identify the visual (non-text) indicators of the component that are required to identify that a control exists, and indicate the current state. In the default (on page load) state, test the contrast ratio against the adjacent colors.</li>
								<li>Test those contrast indicators in each state.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Identify each graphic on the page that includes information required for understanding the content (i.e., excluding graphics which have visible text for the same information, or are decorative) and:
							<ul>
								<li>Check the contrast of the graphical object against its adjacent colors;</li>
								<li>If there are multiple colors and/or a gradient, choose the least contrasting area to test;</li>
								<li>If it passes, move to the next graphical object;</li>
								<li>If the least-contrasting area is less than 3:1, assume that area is invisible, is the graphical object still understandable?</li>
								<li>If there is enough of the graphical object to understand, it passes, else fail.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

		<section id="benefits">
			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<p>People with low vision often have difficulty perceiving graphics that have insufficient contrast. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#relativeluminancedef">relative luminance</a> (lightness difference) of 3:1 or greater can make these items more distinguishable when the person does not see a full range of colors.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Status icons on an application's dashboard (without associated text) have a 3:1 minimum contrast ratio.</li>
				<li>A text input has a dark border around the white editable area.</li>
				<li>A graph uses a light background and ensures that the colors for each line have a 3:1 contrast ratio against the background.</li>
			</ul>

				<p>There are many possible solutions to ensuring contrast, the example shows the use of borders. Other techniques are to use darker colors for the circle backgrounds, or to add text labels &amp; values for each item.</p>

				<p>Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations

				<p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
      Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
      The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
      that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
      target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
      provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
      of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
      to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing

      you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet
