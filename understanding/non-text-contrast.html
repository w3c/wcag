            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that active user interface components
               (i.e., controls) and meaningful graphics are distinguishable by people with moderately
               low vision. The requirements and rationale are similar to those for large text in
               <a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Low contrast controls are more difficult to perceive, and may be completely missed
               by people with a visual impairment. Similarly, if a graphic is needed to understand
               the content or functionality of the webpage then it should be perceivable by people
               with low vision or other impairments without the need for contrast-enhancing assistive
               technology.
            </p>
            <section id="user-interface-components">
               				
               <h3>Active User Interface Components</h3>
               
               				
               <p>For active controls any visual information provided that is necessary for a user to
                  identify that a control is present and how to operate it must have a minimum 3:1 contrast
                  ratio with the adjacent colors. Also, any visual information necessary to indicate
                  state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the
                  information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast
                  ratio.
               </p>
               
               				
               <p>This Success Criterion does not require that changes in color that differentiate between
                  states of an individual component meet the 3:1 contrast ratio when they do not appear
                  next to each other. For example, there is not a new requirement that visited links
                  contrast with the default color, or that mouse hover indicators contrast with the
                  default state. However, the component must not lose contrast with the adjacent colors,
                  and non-text indicators such as the check in a checkbox, or an arrow graphic indicating
                  a menu is selected or open must have sufficient contrast to the adjacent colors.
               </p>
               
               				
               <h3>Boundaries</h3>
               				
               				
               <p>This success criterion does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating
                  the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify
                  the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast. If text (or an icon)
                  within a button or placeholder text inside a text input is visible and there is no
                  visual indication of the hit area then the Success Criterion is passed. If a button
                  with text also has a colored border, since the border does not provide the only indication
                  there is no contrast requirement beyond the text contrast (<a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>). Note that for people with cognitive disabilities it is recommended to delineate
                  the boundary of controls to aid in the recognition of controls and therefore the completion
                  of activities.

               <h3>Adjacent colors</h3>
               				
               <p>For user interface components 'adjacent colors' means the colors adjacent to the component.
                  For example, if an input has a white internal background, dark border, and white external
                  background the 'adjacent color' to the component would be the white external background.
               </p>

                  <figcaption>Figure 2 A standard text input with a grey border (#767676) and white adjacent color outside

               <p>If components use several colors, any color which does not interfere with identifying
                  the component can be ignored for the purpose of measuring contrast ratio. For example,
                  a 3D drop-shadow on an input, or a dark border line between contrasting backgrounds
                  is considered to be subsumed into the color closest in brightness (perceived luminance).
               </p>
               
               				
               <p>The following example shows an input that has a light background on the inside and
                  a dark background around it. The input also has a dark grey border which is considered
                  to be subsumed into the dark background. The border does not interfere with identifying
                  the component, so the contrast ratio is taken between the white background and dark
                  blue background.
               </p>

                     is not required to contrast with either.

                  color might be another part of the component.

               <h3>Relationship with Use of Color and Focus Visible</h3>
               
               				
               <p>The <a href="use-of-color">Use of Color</a> success criterion addresses changing <strong>only the color</strong> (hue) of an object or text without otherwise altering the object's form. The principle
                  is that contrast ratio (the difference in brightness) can be used to distinguish text
                  or graphics. For example, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/general/G183">G183: Using a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text and providing additional visual
                     cues on hover for links or controls where color alone is used to identify them</a> is a technique to use a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text to distinguish
                  links and controls. In that case the Working Group regards a link color that meets
                  the 3:1 contrast ratio relative to the non-linked text color as satisfying the Success
                  Criterion <a href="use-of-color">1.4.1 Use of color</a> since it is relying on contrast ratio as well as color (hue) to convey that the text
                  is a link.
               </p>
               
               				
               <p>Non-text information within controls that uses a change of hue alone to convey the
                  value or state of an input, such as a 1-5 star indicator with a black outline for
                  each star filled with either yellow (full) or white (empty) is likely to fail the
                  Use of color criterion rather than this one.

               <p>Using a change of contrast for focus and other states is a technique to differentiate
                  the states. This is the basis for <a class="general" href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/general/G195">G195: Using an author-supplied, highly visible focus indicator</a>, and more techniques are being added.
               </p>
               
               				
               <p>In combination with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#focus-visible">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a>, the visual focus indicator for a component <em>must</em> have sufficient contrast against the adjacent background when the component is focused,
                  except where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not
                  modified by the author.
               </p>
               
               <p>Note that this Success Criterion does not directly compare the focused and unfocused
                  states of a control - if the focus state relies on a change of color (e.g., changing
                  <em>only</em> the background color of a button), this Success Criterion does not define any requirement
                  for the difference in contrast between the two states.

                  <p>Inactive components, such as disabled controls in HTML, are not available for user
                     interaction. The decision to exempt inactive controls from the contrast requirements
                     was based on a number of considerations. Although it would be benefitial to some people
                     to discern inactive controls, a one-size-fits-all solution has been very difficult
                     to establish. A method of varying the presentation of disabled controls, such as adding
                     an icon for disabled controls, based on user preferences is anticipated as an advancement
                     in the future.

               <p>The term "graphical object" applies to stand-alone icons such as a print icon (with
                  no text), and the important parts of a more complex diagram such as each line in a
                  graph. For simple graphics such as single-color icons the entire image is a graphical
                  object. Images made up of multiple lines, colors and shapes will be made of multiple
                  graphical objects, some of which are required for understanding.
               </p>
               
               				
               <p>Not every graphical object needs to contrast with its surroundings - only those that
                  are required for a user to understand what the graphic is conveying. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Pr.C3.A4gnanz">Gestalt principles</a> such as the "law of continuity" can be used to ignore minor overlaps with other graphical
                  objects or colors.

                     exception is intended to apply when there is no way of presenting the graphic with
                     sufficient contrast without undermining the meaning. For example:
                  </p>
                  					
                  <ul>
                     						
                     <li><strong>Logotypes and flags</strong>: The brand logo of an organization or product is the representation of that organization
                        and therefore exempt. Flags may not be identifiable if the colors are changed to have
                        sufficient contrast.
                     </li>
                     						
                     <li><strong>Sensory</strong>: There is no requirement to change pictures of real life scenes such as photos of
                        people or scenery.

                           <li>Identify the visual (non-text) indicators of the component that are required to identify
                              that a control exists, and indicate the current state. In the default (on page load)
                              state, test the contrast ratio against the adjacent colors.
                           </li>

                           <li>If there is enough of the graphical object to understand, it passes, else fail.</li>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>People with low vision often have difficulty perceiving graphics that have insufficient
               contrast. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that
               lowers the contrast even further. Providing a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#relativeluminancedef">relative luminance</a> (lightness difference) of 3:1 or greater can make these items more distinguishable
               when the person does not see a full range of colors.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.

                        in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text
                        color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot
                        be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text
                        color is specified when a background color is specified.
