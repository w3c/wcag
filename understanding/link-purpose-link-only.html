            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each
               link in the content, so they can decide whether they want to follow it. Best practice
               is that links with the same destination would have the same descriptions, but links
               with different purposes and destinations would have different descriptions (see also
               
               <a href="consistent-identification" class="guideline">Success Criterion 3.2.4</a> which calls for consistency in identifying components that have the same functionality).
               Because the purpose of a link can be identified from its link text, links can be understood
               when they are out of context, such as when the user agent provides a list of all the
               links on a page.
               
            </p>
            <p>The text in the link is intended to describe the purpose of the link. In cases where
               the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name of the document or
               web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link (which is
               to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is not required to use
               the name of the document or web application; other things may also describe the purpose
               of the link. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               
               <a href="page-titled" class="understanding">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application
               being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.
               Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides
               continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the
               link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation,
               the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context
               available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available
               on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made
               available in the link text to satisfy the Success Criterion.
               
            </p>
            <p>The word "mechanism" is used to allow authors to either make all links fully understandable
               out of context by default or to provide a way to make them this way. This is done
               because for some pages, making the links all unambiguous by themselves makes the pages
               easier for some users and harder for others. Providing the ability to make the links
               unambiguous (by them selves) or not provides both users with disabilities with the
               ability to use the page in the format that best meets their needs.
               
            </p>
            <p>For example: A page listing 100 book titles along with links to download the books
               in HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, MP3, or AAC might ordinarily be viewed as the title of the
               book as a link with the words "in HTML" after it. then the sentence "Also available
               in: " followed by a series of short links with text of "HTML", "PDF", "DOC", "TXT",
               "MP3", and "AAC". At Level 3, some users could opt to view the page this way - because
               they would find the page harder to understand or slower to use if the full title of
               the book were included in each of the links. Others could opt to view the page with
               the full title as part of each of the links so that each link was understandable in
               itself. Both the former and the latter groups could include people with visual or
               cognitive disabilities that used different techniques to browse or that had different
               types or severities of disability.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
