<section id="intent">
        <h2>Intent</h2>

        <p>The intent of this success criterion is to help ensure targets can be easily activated without accidentally activating an adjacent target.  Users with dexterity limitations and those who have difficulty with fine motor movement find it difficult to accurately activate small targets when there are other targets that are too close.  Providing sufficient size, or sufficient spacing between targets, will reduce the likelihood of accidentally activating the wrong control.</p>
        <p>Disabilities addressed by this requirement include hand tremors, spasticity, and quadriplegia.  Some people with disabilities use specialized input devices instead of a computer mouse or trackpad.  Typically these types of input device do not provide as much accuracy as mainstream pointing devices.  Meeting this requirement also ensures that touchscreen interfaces are easier to use.</p>
        <div class="note">
				<p class="note-title marker">Note</p>
				<p>This success criterion defines a <em>minimum size</em> and, if this can't be met, a <em>minimum spacing</em>. It is still possible to have very small, and difficult to activate, targets and meet the requirements of this Success Criterion, provided that the targets don't have any adjacent targets that are too close. However, using larger target sizes will help many people use targets more easily. <em>As a best practice</em> it is recommended to at least meet the <em>minimum size</em> requirement of the Success Criterion, regardless of spacing. For important links/controls, consider aiming for the stricter <a href="target-size-enhanced.html">2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)</a>.</p>
			</div>

        <section id="exceptions">
            <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <p>The requirement is for targets to be at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels in size. There are five exceptions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the <a href="#dfn-minimum-bounding-box">bounding box</a> of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target.</li>
                <li><strong>Equivalent:</strong> In cases where a target does not have a size equivalent to 24 by 24 CSS pixels, but there is another control that can achieve the underlying function that <em>does</em> meet the requirements of this success criterion, the target can be excepted based on the "Equivalent" exception.</li>
                <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The success criterion does not apply to inline targets in sentences, or where the size of the target is constrained by the line-height of non-target text. This exception is allowed because text reflow based on viewport size makes it impossible for authors to anticipate where links may be positioned relative to one another. Applying this success criterion when multiple links are embedded in blocks of smaller text often results in an undesirable design. It is more important to set the line height to a value that improves readability.</li>
                <li><strong>User agent control:</strong> Browsers have default renderings of some controls, such as the days of the month calendar in an <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code>. As long as the author has not modified the user agent default size, the target size for a <q>User agent control</q> is excepted.</li>
                <li><strong>Essential:</strong> If the size and spacing of the targets is fundamental to the information being conveyed, the <q>Essential</q> exception applies. For example, in digital maps, the position of pins is analogous to the position of places shown on the map. If there are many pins close together, the spacing between pins and neighboring pins will often be below 24 CSS pixels. It is essential to show the pins at the correct map location, therefore the Essential exception applies. A similar example is an interactive data visualization where targets are necessarily dense. Another example is where jurisdictions legally require online forms to replicate paper forms, which can impose constraints on the size of targets. In such jurisdictions, any legal requirement to replicate small targets can be considered essential. When the "Essential" exception is applicable, authors are strongly encouraged to provide equivalent functionality through alternative means to the extent practical.</li>

            <h3>Size requirement</h3>

            <p>For a target to be "at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels", it must be conceptually possible to draw a solid 24 by 24 CSS pixel square, aligned to the horizontal and vertical axis such that the square is completely within the target (does not extend outside the target's area).</p>

            </figure>

            <p>If a target is not large enough to allow for a 24 by 24px square to be drawn inside it, it is considered <em>undersized</em>, and does not pass the size requirement of the success criterion. However, if it has sufficient space around it without adjacent targets, it may still pass the criterion thanks to the spacing exception (below).</p>

            </figure>

            <p>The requirement is independent of the zoom factor of the page; when users zoom in, the CSS pixel size of elements does not change. This means that authors cannot meet it by claiming that the target will have enough spacing or sufficient size if the user zooms into the page.</p>
        
            <p>The requirement does not apply to targets while they are obscured by content displayed as a result of a user interaction or scripted behavior of content, for example:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>interacting with a combobox shows a dropdown list of suggestions</li>
                <li>activating a button displays a modal dialog</li>
                <li>content displays a cookie banner after page load</li>
                <li>content displays a "Take a survey" dialog after some period of user inactivity</li>
            </ul>    
            <p>The requirement does however apply to targets in any new content that appears on top of other content.</p>

            <p>While the success criterion primarily helps touch users by providing target sizing to prevent accidental triggering of adjacent targets, it is also useful for mouse or pen users. It reduces the chances of erroneous activation due to either a tremor or reduced precision, whether because of reduced fine motor control or input imprecision.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="spacing">
            <h3>Spacing</h3>

            <p>When the minimum size for a target is not met, spacing can at least improve the user experience. There is less chance of accidentally activating a neighboring target if a target is not immediately adjacent to another. Touchscreen devices and user agents generally have internal heuristics to identify which link or control is closest to a user's touch interaction - this means that sufficient spacing between targets can work as effectively as a larger target size itself.</p>

            <p>When a target is smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels, it is <em>undersized</em>. In this case, we check if it at least has sufficient <em>spacing</em> by drawing an imaginary 24 CSS pixel diameter circle over the undersized target, centered on the target's <a href="#dfn-minimum-bounding-box">bounding box</a>. For rectangular targets, the bounding box coincides with the target itself â€“ thus, the circle is placed on the center of the target. If the target is <em>not</em> rectangular â€“ for instance, if the target is clipped, has rounded corners, or if it's a more complex clickable SVG shape â€“ we need to first determine the bounding box, and then find the box's center. Note that for concave shapes, the center of the bounding box may be outside of the target itself. Now, we center the circle on the center of the bounding box.</p>

            <figure id="target-size-bounding-boxes">
                <img src="img/target-size-bounding-boxes.svg" width="395" height="100" alt="Three undersized targets - a square target, a convex target, and a concave target; the concave and convex targets have a bounding box around them; all three targets have a 24 CSS pixel circle centered on the center of their bounding box">
                <figcaption><p><span>Figure 4.</span> For a square/rectangular target, the 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the target itself. For convex and concave targets, it is centered on the bounding box of the shape. Note the concave target, where in this case the center of the bounding box is outside of the actual target (image shown to scale - <a href="img/target-size-bounding-boxes.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</p></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>We repeat this process for all adjacent undersized targets. To determine if an undersized target has sufficient spacing (to pass this Success Criterion's spacing exception), we check that the 24 CSS pixel diameter circle of the target does not intersect another target or the circle of any other adjacent undersized targets.</p>

            <p>The following example shows three versions of a horizontal row of six icon-based buttons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the top row, the dimensions of each target are 24 by 24 CSS pixels, passing this success criterion.</li>
                <li>In the second row, the same targets are only 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have a 4 CSS pixel space between them â€“ as the target size is below 24 by 24 CSS pixels, these need to be evaluated against the Success Criterion's spacing exception, and they pass.</li>
                <li>In the last row, the targets are again 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have no space between them â€“ these fail the spacing exception. This is because the imaginary 24 CSS pixel diameter circles over the targets would intersect.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The next two illustrations show sets of buttons which are only 16 CSS pixels tall. In the first set, there are no targets immediately above or below the buttons, so they pass. In the second illustration, there are further buttons, and they have been stacked on top of one another, resulting in a fail.</p>

In the second illustration, the same menu is expanded, but the menu items only achieve 18 CSS pixels in height, and so fail.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>The following example has one large target (an image that links to a new page related to that image) and a very small second target (a control with a magnifier icon to open a zoomed-in preview, possibly in a modal, of the image).</p>
            <p>In the top row, the small target overlaps - or, to be more technically accurate, <em>clips</em> - the large target. The small target itself has a size of 24 by 24 CSS pixels, so passes. In the second row, we see that if the second target is any smaller â€“ in this case 16 by 16 CSS pixels â€“ it fails the criterion, as the imaginary circle with a 24 CSS pixel diameter we draw over the small target will intersect the large target itself.</p>

            <figure id="target-large-small-clipping">

            </figure>

            <p>In the following example, we have the same two targets â€“ a large target and a small target. This time, the small target touches/abuts the large target. If the small target is smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels, the imaginary circle with a 24 CSS pixel diameter we draw over the small target will intersect the large target itself, failing the requirement. The undersized target must be spaced further away from the large target until its circle doesn't intersect the large target.</p>

                <img src="img/target-large-small-touching.svg" width="460" height="320" alt="Two rows showing a small target and a large target touching/abutting">
                <figcaption><p><span>Figure 10.</span> In the first row, the 16 by 16 CSS pixel target touching/abutting the large target fails, as its 24 CSS pixel diameter circle used for undersized targets intersects the large target.

				<p class="note-title marker">Note</p>
				<p>Users with different disabilities have different needs for control sizes. It can be beneficial to provide an option to increase the active target area without increasing the visible target size. Another option is to provide a mechanism to control the density of layout and thereby change target size or spacing, or both. This can be beneficial for a wide range of users. For example, users with visual field loss may prefer a more condensed layout with smaller sized controls while users with other forms of low vision may prefer large controls.</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Three buttons are on-screen and the target size of each button is 24 by 24 CSS pixels. Since the target size itself is 24 by 24 CSS pixels, no additional spacing is required, the success criterion passes.</li>
            <li>A row of buttons, each of which has a horizontal width of more than 24 CSS pixels, a height of only 20 CSS pixels, and vertical margin of 4 CSS pixels above and below the row of buttons. Since there is sufficient spacing both above and below the row of buttons, the success criterion passes.</li>
            <li>Links within a paragraph of text have varying target dimensions. Links within paragraphs of text do not need to meet the 24 by 24 CSS pixels requirements, so the success criterion passes.</li>

      target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
      provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
