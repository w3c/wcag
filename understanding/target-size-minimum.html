            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help ensure targets can be easily activated
               without accidentally activating an adjacent target. When targets are small, it is
               difficult for users with hand tremors and those who have difficulty with fine motor
               movement to activate them accurately. Providing sufficient size, or sufficient spacing
               between targets, will reduce the likelihood of accidentally activating the wrong control.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion defines a <em>minimum</em> size; using larger sizes will help many people use targets more easily. Meeting <a href="../21/target-size-enhanced.html">2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)</a> is recommended whenever possible.
            </p>
            <p>The requirement is for targets to be at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels in size. There are
               five exceptions:
            </p>
            <ol>
               
               <li>If a target is smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels but has sufficient spacing, it passes.
                  The spacing is sufficient if the offset between targets is at least 24 CSS pixels.
                  Target offset measures the distance between targets, measured from the farthest point
                  of one target to the nearest point of the adjacent target, and is assessed for each
                  of the adjacent targets. What edge of the target is <em>farthest</em> depends on the relative position of the neighboring target. For example, if considering
                  distance above the target, the farthest edge would be the bottom of the target, and
                  the offset would be measured from this bottom edge to the bottom edge of the neighboring
                  target above. Note that where the targets differ in size or shape, the offset between
                  targets may also differ. The offset distance must be at least 24 CSS pixels in all
                  cases to fall under this exception.
               </li>
               
               <li>The Success Criterion does not apply to inline targets in blocks of text – for example,
                  text links inside a sentence or paragraph. This exception is allowed because text
                  reflow based on viewport size makes it impossible for authors to anticipate where
                  links may be positioned relative to one another. When multiple links are embedded
                  in blocks of texts in smaller text sizes, maintaining a 24 CSS pixels offset between
                  links in adjacent lines of text would require a large line height which can be undesirable
                  in many design contexts. Also, inline numeric footnotes common in scientific texts
                  may sometimes have a width well below 24 CSS pixels. Note: Stacked lists of links,
                  as in navigation structures, do not count as inline links. Authors can anticipate
                  the relative position of these links and accommodate sufficient target spacing.
               </li>
               
               <li>If the spacing of the targets is essential to the information being conveyed, the
                  "Essential" exception applies. For example, in digital maps, the position of pins
                  is analogous to the position of places shown on the map. If there are many pins close
                  together, the offset between pins and neighboring pins will often be below 24 CSS
                  pixels. It is essential to show the pins at the correct map location, therefore the
                  Essential exception applies. As well, some jurisdictions legally require online forms
                  to replicate paper forms, which can impose constraints on the size of targets. In
                  such jurisdictions, any legal requirement to replicate small targets can be considered
                  essential.
               </li>
               
               <li>Browsers have default renderings of some controls, such as the days of the month calendar
                  in an <code>input type="date"</code>. As long as the author has not modified the user agent default, the target size for
                  a "User agent control" is excepted.
               </li>
               
               <li>In cases where a target does not have an area equivalent to 24 by 24 CSS pixels, but
                  there is another control that can achieve the underlying function that <em>does</em> meet the minimum area, the target can be excepted based on the "Equivalent" exception.
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            <p>The requirement is independent of the zoom factor of the page; when users zoom in
               the CSS pixel size of elements does not change. This means that authors cannot meet
               it by claiming that the target will have enough spacing or sufficient size if the
               user zooms into the page.
            </p>
            <p>The requirement does not apply to targets while they are obscured by content displayed
               as a result of a user interaction or scripted behavior of content, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>interacting with a combobox shows a dropdown list of suggestions</li>
               
               <li>activating a button displays a modal dialog</li>
               
               <li>content displays a cookie banner after page load</li>
               
               <li>content displays a "Take a survey" dialog after some period of user inactivity</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>The requirement does however apply to targets in any new content that appears on top
               of other content.
            </p>
            <p>While the Success Criterion primarily helps touch users by providing target sizing
               to prevent accidental triggering of adjacent targets, it is also useful for mouse
               or pen users. It reduces the chances of erroneous activation due to either a tremor
               or reduced precision, whether because of reduced fine motor control or input imprecision.
            </p>
            <p>Spacing, alone and in conjunction with size, can improve user experience. There is
               less chance of accidentally activating a neighboring target if a target is not immediately
               adjacent to another. Touchscreen devices and user agents generally have internal heuristics
               to identify which link or control is closest to a user's touch interaction - this
               means that sufficient spacing around a target can work as effectively as a larger
               target size itself.
            </p>
            <p>The following illustrate a variety of situations using size and spacing of targets.
               In the top line of icons, the dimensions of each icon target are 44 by 44 CSS pixels
               with no space in between. This amply passes this Success Criterion and is actually
               sufficient to meet the AAA requirement for <a href="../21/target-size-enhanced.html">Target Size (Enhanced)</a>. In the next row, the dimensions of each icon target are 24 by 24 CSS pixels with
               no space in between, passing this Success Criterion. In the third row, the the same
               icon targets are only 20 by 20 CSS pixels but they have a 4 CSS pixel space in between,
               passing this Success Criterion via the spacing exception. In the last row, the the
               same icon targets are only 20 by 20 CSS pixels and have no space in between, failing
               this Success Criterion.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>When targets are not 24 by 24 CSS pixels, it is still possible to meet this Success
               Criterion. The next two illustrations show sets of buttons which are only 20 CSS pixels
               tall. In the first set, there are no targets immediately above or below the buttons,
               so they pass. In the second illustration, the buttons have been stacked on top of
               one another, resulting in a fail.

                  height is only 20 CSS pixels. However, the lack of adjacent targets above and below
                  means that the targets pass this Success Criterion.

               <figcaption>Figure 3 <strong>Fail:</strong> Two rows of buttons, both with a height of only 20 CSS pixels. The rows are flush,
                  with no gap between them, which means that the offset from the top of the targets
                  in the top row to the top of targets in the row below is below 24px, thus failing
                  the Success Criterion.

            </figure>
            <p>The following two illustrations show how menu items can be adjusted to properly meet
               this requirement. In the first illustration, the <q>About us</q> menu has been activated, showing that each of the menu item targets (text and padding)
               has a 24 CSS pixel height. In the second illustration, the same menu is expanded,
               but the menu items only achieve 20 CSS pixels in height.
            </p>

               <img src="img/pointer-target-example4.jpg" alt="A dropdown menu - a pass example with menu items 24 CSS pixels high, and a fail example with menu items only 20 CSS pixels high." />
               
               <figcaption>Figure 4 A dropdown menu is shown. The PASS example has menu items which are 24 CSS pixels
                  high. In the FAIL example, the menu items are only 20 CSS pixels high.
               </figcaption>
               
            </figure>
            <p>The following three examples illustrate how a target's position relative to another
               target affects the offset. Each illustration shows a person's profile image, which
               is a target leading to the profile page, as well as a magnifying glass icon, which
               opens a lightbox view of the profile image. In the first example, the magnifying icon
               is outside of the picture. Its horizontal dimension is 24 CSS pixels. The vertical
               dimension is below 24 CSS pixels but since there are no adjacent targets above and
               below, the target meets the Success Criterion. In the second example, the icon overlaps
               with the top-left corner of the image. The image, itself a target, is immediately
               adjacent to the magnifying glass icon. Measuring from the top of the magnifying glass
               icon to the nearest point of the image target shows that that the offset is only 20
               CSS pixels. The second example therefore fails the Success Criterion. In the third
               example, the magnifying glass icon sits inside the linked image. Since it is surrounded
               by a larger target, the offset to the surrounding and immediately adjacent image target
               is only 20 CSS pixels at top and bottom. The icon target fails.

               <figcaption>Figure 6 Two examples show inline text links. The first example has various links in a block
                  of text. The font size is 14px, line height is 16.8px. Depending on the position of
                  links in the text, the vertical offset of links is smaller than 24 CSS pixels. For
                  linked footnote numbers, the horizontal offset is also below 24 CSS pixels. The inline
                  exception allows inline targets to have an offset below the requirement of 24 by 24
                  CSS pixels.

               <figcaption>Figure 7 The two examples show lists of stacked links as used in navigation, for example in
                  a list of contents of a longer text page. In both cases, the font size is 14px. In
                  the first example, the line height is 25.8px, exceeding the requirement of 24 CSS
                  pixels. In the second example, the stacked links have a line height of just 16.8px.
                  They do not meet the vertical offset requirement of 24 CSS pixels.

            <p>Users with different disabilities have different needs for control sizes. It can be
               beneficial to provide an option to increase the active target area without increasing
               the visible target size. Another option is to provide a mechanism to control the density
               of layout and thereby change target size or spacing, or both. This can be beneficial
               for a wide range of users. For example, users with visual field loss may prefer a
               more condensed layout with smaller sized controls while users with other forms of
               low vision may prefer large controls.
            </p>
            <p>The aim of this Success Criterion is that targets are ideally at least 24 by 24 CSS
               pixels. However, the offset exception allows for smaller targets if there is sufficient
               spacing around them. Authors should be aware that using smaller targets can have an
               impact on layouts, as the combined space of the smaller target and the required spacing
               around it will generally require an overall area that is larger than 24 by 24 CSS
               pixels.

               <figcaption>Figure 9 In this (hypothetical) cross arrangement of five 24 by 24 pixel targets, shrinking
                  the central target to 10 by 10 pixels, with spacing of only 7 pixels to the other
                  targets, will fail the Success Criterion. To pass, the outer targets will need to
                  be moved further out, to achieve a spacing of 14 pixels - leading to an increase of
                  the overall space occupied by the five targets.

            <ul>
               
               <li>Three buttons are on-screen and the target area of each button is 24 by 24 CSS pixels.
                  Since the target size itself is 24 by 24 CSS pixels, no additional spacing is required,
                  the Success Criterion passes.
               </li>
               
               <li>A row of buttons, each of which has a horizontal width of more than 24 CSS pixels,
                  but a height of only 20 CSS pixels. Since there is sufficient spacing above and below
                  the row of buttons, the Success Criterion passes.
               </li>
               
               <li>Links within a paragraph of text have varying target dimensions. Links within paragraphs
                  of text do not need to meet the 24 by 24 CSS pixels requirements, so the Success Criterion
                  passes.
