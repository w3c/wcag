<h2><a name="abstract" id="abstract"> </a>Abstract</h2><p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. 
        Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general. 
      </p><p>WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a> for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.
</p><p>WCAG 2.0 succeeds <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>
    		<a href="#WCAG10">[WCAG10]</a>, which was published as a W3C Recommendation May 1999. Although it is possible to conform either to WCAG 1.0 or to WCAG 2.0 (or both), the W3C recommends that new and updated content use WCAG 2.0. The W3C also recommends that Web accessibility policies reference WCAG 2.0.</p></div><div>

		<h2><a name="intro" id="intro"> </a>Introduction </h2><p>This section is <a title="definition: informative" href="#informativedef" class="termref">informative</a>. </p><p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0  defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general. 
      </p><p>WCAG 2.0 is developed through the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process.php">W3C process</a> in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for Web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.0 builds on WCAG 1.0 <a href="#WCAG10">[WCAG10]</a> and is designed to apply broadly to different Web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a>.</p><p>Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible Web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in Web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of Web development and interaction work together, see:</p><ul><li><p>

          </p></li></ul><div class="div2"> <h3><a name="intro-layers-guidance" id="intro-layers-guidance"> </a>WCAG 2.0 Layers of Guidance</h3><p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include Web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall <em>principles</em>, general <em>guidelines</em>, testable <em>success criteria</em> and a rich collection of <em>sufficient techniques, advisory techniques</em>, and <em>documented common failures</em> with examples, resource links and code.</p><ul><li><p>
              <strong>Principles</strong> - At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for Web accessibility: <em>perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust</em>. See also <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head" class="understanding-ref">Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility</a>.</p></li><li><p>
              <strong>Guidelines</strong> - Under the principles are guidelines. The 12 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.</p></li><li><p>
              <strong>Success Criteria</strong> - For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.0 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest).  Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head" class="understanding-ref">Understanding Levels of Conformance</a>.</p></li><li><p>
              <strong>Sufficient and Advisory Techniques</strong> - For each of the <em>guidelines</em> and <em>success criteria</em> in the WCAG 2.0 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of <em>techniques</em>. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are <em>sufficient</em> for meeting the success criteria and those that are <em>advisory</em>. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-layers-techs-head" class="understanding-ref">Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.0</a>.</p></li></ul><p>All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users.</p><p>Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive language and learning areas.  Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that Web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/appendixC.html#understanding-metadata" class="understanding-ref">Metadata</a> may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs.

For example, the term "Web page" includes an immersive, interactive movie-like experience found at a single URI.

					</em>When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet floating alongside. This might be a single-page Web site or just one page within a Web site.</p></div></dd></dl></div><div class="div1">
