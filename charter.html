				<h2>Scope</h2>
				<p>The group will:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Develop Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 to address gaps in WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 related to content with a particular focus on users of mobile devices and people with low vision or with cognitive disabilities.</li>
					<li>Continue development of a repository of test rules that uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format-1.0/">Accessibility Conformance Rules Format</a>, to promote a unified interpretation of WCAG 2.x among different web accessibility test tools.</li>
					<li>Develop a new standard (name to be decided) to succeed WCAG 2.x based on the work of the Silver Task Force. The goal is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products when using the guidelines on a variety of platforms. As noted in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/">Draft Requirements</a>, it will use a different framework to allow it to address more disability needs, address emerging technologies on the web such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It will provide non-normative information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. This framework is intended to support better coverage across disabilities, and be easier to maintain, so that the new framework will be more durable over time as technologies evolve. This will require development of a new conformance model, engaging policy makers in that process, and testing the model
						with policy makers from different settings. For clarity across different settings, the non-normative information will avoid RFC2119 language (e.g. “must”) for non-web technologies.</li>
					<li>Maintain <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)</a> as needed.</li>
					<li>Continue development of non-normative documents to support implementation of accessibility guidelines.</li>
				</ul>
				<section id="section-out-of-scope">
					<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
					<p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working group.</p>
					<ul class="out-of-scope">
						<li>The AG WG is not required to be the central repository for accessibility support data.</li>
						<li>The AG WG does not perform conformance evaluations and reviews.</li>
						<li>The AG WG does not give normative guidance on non-web technologies; however, it may cite examples outside the web scope.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="success-criteria">
					<h3>Success Criteria</h3>
					<p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
					<p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security, privacy, and internationalization implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
					<p>There should be sufficient techniques and tests for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.</p>

				<p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state.</p>
				<section id="normative">
					<h3> Normative Specifications </h3>
					<p> The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications: </p>
					<dl>
						<dt id="wcag22" class="spec"><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This specification defines updated guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities, updating WCAG 2.1 with additional guidance to better address needs for users with low vision or cognitive disabilities, and users of touch and mobile interfaces. Candidate Success Criteria will be vetted according to careful <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/requirements/22/#success-criterion-acceptance-criteria">WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion Acceptance Criteria</a> and follow a methodical and consistent working process.</p>
							<p class="draft-status"><b>Draft state:</b>
								<a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/">Editor's Draft</a></p>
							<p class="milestone"><b>Expected completion:</b> Q4 2020</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="silver" class="spec"><span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/">Silver (provisional name)</a></span></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This specification creates a new framework and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities, supporting a wider set of user needs, using new approaches to testing, and allowing more frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. Each guideline in Silver will focus on user needs rather than structural features or types of content, and will be supported by technology-specific methods to meet that need. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 is expected to substantially conform to a conformance level of Silver, though Silver is expected to have many differences from WCAG 2.x. Since Silver will use a different conformance model, the Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.x, while others may wish to migrate to Silver. For those that wish to migrate to Silver, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and /
								or other approaches to facilitate migration. </p>
							<p class="draft-status"><b>Draft state:</b>
								<a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/">Editor's Draft</a></p>
							<p class="milestone"><b>Expected completion:</b> Q2 2023 (<span class="note">Note: this is a projected date after the expiry of this charter and will be revised in a subsequent charter based on progess.</span>)</p>

			<section id="communication">
				<h2> Communication </h2>
				<p id="public"> Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however. </p>
				<p> Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group home page.</a>
