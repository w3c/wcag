        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the

Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

          Decision Policy

        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'><i class="todo">[pick a duration within:] one week to 10 working days</i></span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

          This Working Group operates under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a> (Version of 15 September 2020). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Web specifications that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis.

          For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/[shortname]/ipr">licensing information</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
