  <h1>Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.13 Content on hover or focus when the pointer cannot be moved over the new popup content without it automatically closing</h1>
    <section class="meta"><p class="id">ID: F114</p><p class="technology">Technology: failures</p><p class="type">Type: Failure</p></section><section id="applicability">
      <h2>When to Use</h2>
      <p>Applies when the user, by hovering over parts of content or by focusing an element via the keyboard, causes popup content to appear and cannot move the pointer over the new popup in order to fully access its contents without the popup automatically closing.</p>
   </section><section id="description">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Content elements may respond to receiving keyboard focus or pointer hover by inserting additional popup content that may now cover other parts of content. For users who use strong page magnification, the popup content is often only partly visible in the enlarged viewport. A common way to access those parts that are hidden is by moving the pointer over the popup content, thereby automatically moving the viewport (the enlarged section).</p>
     <p>In some cases, content is designed in a way where moving the pointer outside the trigger that caused the popup content to appear will automatically close the popup. This makes it impossible for pointer users, especially those using strong magnification, to access the full content of the popup.</p>

     <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Custom tooltip:</strong> When hovering the pointer over an icon with a question mark that is placed after an input field, a popup window with an explanation of the expected input appears to the left of the icon. Parts of the popup may not be visible in the current enlarged viewport. The attempt to move the pointer towards the popup content causes it to close as soon the pointer is no longer over the target area of the trigger.</li>
        <li><strong>Sub-menu:</strong> When the pointer is moved over the entry in a menubar, a submenu appears. Moving the pointer over the submenu closes the menu.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
             <ul>
                <li>Using pointer, explore the page content, especially interactive menus and icon controls, to check for popups appearing on pointer hover.</li>
                <li>If popup content appears, move the pointer over the popup content.</li>
            </ul>
 
      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>If popup content closes when moving the pointer over it, then this failure condition applies and content fails the success criterion.</li>
         </ul>
