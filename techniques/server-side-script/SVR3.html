			<h2>When to Use</h2>
      <p>Content created using server-side scripting where a conforming version of content is provided as an alternative to a non-conforming version based on HTTP Referer.</p>
   </section>
	 <section id="description">
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users can obtain an accessible version of content where both non-conforming and conforming versions are provided.</p>
		<p><a href="../../Understanding/conformance#conf-req1">Conformance Requirement 1</a> allows non-conforming pages to be included within the scope of conformance as long as they have a <a>conforming alternate version</a>. It is not always possible for authors to include accessibility supported links to conforming content from within non-conforming content. Therefore, authors may need to rely on the use of Server Side Scripting technologies (ex. <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, <abbr title="Active Server Pages">ASP</abbr>, <abbr title="Java Server Pages">JSP</abbr>) to ensure that the non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page.</p>
		<p>This technique describes how to use information provided by the HTTP referer to ensure that non-conforming content can only be reached from a conforming page. The HTTP referer header is set by the user agent and contains the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> of the page (if any) which referred the user agent to the non-conforming page.</p>
		<p>To implement this technique, an author identifies the URI for the conforming version of the content, for each non-conforming page. When a request for the non-conforming version of a page is received, the server compares the value of the HTTP referer header against the URI of the conforming version to determine whether the link to the non-conforming version came from the conforming version. The non-conforming version is only served if the HTTP referer matches the URI of the non-conforming version. Otherwise, the user is redirected to the conforming version of the content. Note that when comparing the URI in the HTTP referer header, non-relevant variations in the URI, such as in the query and target, should be taken into account.</p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <section class="example">
         <h3>Interactive demonstrations of physical processes</h3>
         <p>An online physics course uses a proprietary modeling language to provide interactive demonstrations of physical processes. The user agent for the modeling language is not compatible with assistive technology. The site includes a script that uses the HTTP referer to ensure that unless users attempt to access the interactive demonstration from a page that contains a conforming description of the process and models, the server redirects the request to a conforming page which contains a link to the non-conforming version. Students may choose to access the non-conforming, interactive version, but those who do not are still able to learn about the process.</p>

         <h3>Using HTTP referer in PHP</h3>
				 <p>The following example illustrates how this technique can be used in PHP. It includes two files, conforming.php and non-conforming.php which work together to ensure that the only way to access non-conforming content is from conforming content.</p>
            
             <section id="conforming-php">
               <h4>Conforming PHP</h4>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Conforming Content&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;This is a conforming page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From here, you can visit the &lt;a href="non-conforming.php"&gt;non-conforming 
    page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
            </section>

            <section id="non-conforming-php">
         
               <h4>Non-conforming PHP</h4>
         
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-php">&lt;?php 
// if the request comes from a file that contains the string "conforming.php" 
// then render the page
  if(stristr($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], "conforming.php")) {
?&gt;	
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Non-Conforming Content&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;This is a non-conforming page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because you came from &lt;?php echo $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']; ?&gt;, 
   you are able to view the content on this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;?php
 }
// if the referring page is not conforming.php, then redirect the user to 
// the conforming version
else  {
header("Location: conforming.php");
}
?&gt;</code></pre>
