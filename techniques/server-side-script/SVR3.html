      <p>Content created using server-side scripting where a conforming version of content is provided as an alternative to a non-conforming version based on HTTP Referer.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users can obtain an accessible version of content where both non-conforming and conforming versions are provided.</p>
      <p>
         <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conf-req1">Conformance Requirement 1</a> allows non-conforming pages to be included within the scope of conformance as long as they have a "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternate version</a>". It is not always possible for authors to include accessibility supported links to conforming content from within non-conforming content. Therefore, authors may need to rely on the use of Server Side Scripting technologies (ex. PHP, ASP, JSP) to ensure that the non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page.</p>
      <p>This technique describes how to use information provided by the HTTP referer to ensure that non-conforming content can only be reached from a conforming page. The HTTP referer header is set by the user agent and contains the URI of the page (if any) which referred the user agent to the non-conforming page.</p>
      <p>To implement this technique, an author identifies the URI for the conforming version of the content, for each non-conforming page. When a request for the non-conforming version of a page is received, the server compares the value of the HTTP referer header against the URI of the conforming version to determine whether the link to the non-conforming version came from the conforming version. The non-conforming version is only served if the HTTP referer matches the URI of the non-conforming version. Otherwise, the user is redirected to the conforming version of the content. Note that when comparing the URI in the HTTP referer header, non-relevant variations in the URI, such as in the query and target, should be taken into account.</p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Interactive demonstrations of physical processes</h3>
         
            <p>An online physics course uses a proprietary modeling language to provide interactive demonstrations of physical processes. The user agent for the modeling language is not compatible with assistive technology. The site includes a script that uses the HTTP referer to ensure that unless users attempt to access the interactive demonstration from a page that contains a conforming description of the process and models, the server redirects the request to a conforming page which contains a link to the non-conforming version. Students may choose to access the non-conforming, interactive version, but those who do not are still able to learn about the process.</p>

         <h3>Using HTTP referer in PHP</h3>
         
            <p>The following example illustrates how this technique can be used in PHP. It includes two files, conforming.php and non-conforming.php which work together to ensure that the only way to access non-conforming content is from conforming content.</p>
            <p>conforming.php:</p>
         
         <pre xml:space="preserve">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" 
	"https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
    		&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" /&gt;
    		&lt;title&gt;Conforming Content&lt;/title&gt;
    	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;This is a conforming page&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;From here, you can visit the &lt;a href="non-conforming.php"&gt;non-conforming 
		page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    				</pre>
         
            <p>non-conforming.php:</p>
         
         <pre xml:space="preserve">
&lt;?php 
// if the request comes from a file that contains the string "conforming.php" then render the page
	if(stristr($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], "conforming.php")) {
?&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"

		&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" /&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;Non-Conforming Content&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;This is a non-conforming page&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Because you came from &lt;?php echo $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']; ?&gt;, you are 
			able to view the content on this page. &lt;/p&gt;
