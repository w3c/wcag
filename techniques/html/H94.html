			<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to avoid key errors that are known
    				to cause problems for assistive technologies when they are trying to
    				parse content that has duplicate attributes on the same element. This
    				can be checked manually, or by using HTML's mechanism to specify the
    				technology and technology version and validating the document for this
    				condition. There are several validators that the developer can use;
    				validation reports generally mention this type of error. The document
    				type declaration is not strictly necessary for this type of evaluation,
    				but specifying the document type declaration makes it easier to use
    				a validator.</p>

		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<section class="example">
			<h3>HTML Validators</h3>
      <p>HTML pages include a document type declaration (sometimes referred to as <code>!DOCTYPE</code> statement). The developer can use offline or online validators (see Resources below) to check that attributes are only used once on an element. The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> validator, for example, will report <samp>Error duplicate attribute [attribute name]</samp> when it encounters the second definition of the same attribute on an element.</p>
