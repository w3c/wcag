      <p>HTML documents that include images that cannot be
          described in a short text alternative. </p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p> The objective of this technique is to provide information in a file designated by the
            <code class="att">longdesc</code> attribute when a short text alternative does not adequately convey the function
            or information provided in the image. The <code class="att">longdesc</code> attribute is a URI, the target of
            which contains a long description of the non-text content. </p>
      <p>Authors can provide a description for an image by including text in a separate resource or within the text of the page containing the image.  An advantage of using a separate resource for the description is that it is easily reusable for multiple instances of the same image, it does not add on-page visual clutter to the original document, and the description's end-point is apparent to the user. An advantage of providing the description within the same page as the image is that all users can access the description.  A limitation of the on-page method, as well as in providing multiple descriptions on a single separate page, is that current implementations supporting longdesc do not identify the long description's end-point. Authors can solve this by providing a well-formed description, which identifies the where the description ends.</p>
