      <p>HTML documents that include images that cannot be
          described in a short text alternative. </p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p> The objective of this technique is to provide information in a file designated by the
            <code class="att">longdesc</code> attribute when a short text alternative does not adequately convey the function
            or information provided in the image. The <code class="att">longdesc</code> attribute is a URI, the target of
            which contains a long description of the non-text content. </p>
      <p>Authors can provide a description for an image by including text in a separate resource or within the text of the page containing the image.  An advantage of using a separate resource for the description is that it is easily reusable for multiple instances of the same image, it does not add on-page visual clutter to the original document, and the description's end-point is apparent to the user. An advantage of providing the description within the same page as the image is that all users can access the description.  A limitation of the on-page method, as well as in providing multiple descriptions on a single separate page, is that current implementations supporting longdesc do not identify the long description's end-point. Authors can solve this by providing a well-formed description, which identifies the where the description ends.</p>

         <h3>Using longdesc to refer to a long description contained on a separate resource.</h3>
         <pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="chart.gif" alt="a complex chart" longdesc="chartdesc.html"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

         <h3>Using longdesc to refer to a long description within the same page.</h3>
         <pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;img longdesc="thispage.html#desc" alt="Line graph of the number of subscribers" src="http://www.company/images/graph.png"&gt;
&lt;div id="desc"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Long Description: Line graph of the number of subscribers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!-- Full Description of Graph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long description ends.&lt;/p&gt;

         <ol>
            <li>Check that the <code class="el">img</code> element has a longdesc attribute. </li>
            <li>Check that the value of the <code class="att">longdesc</code> attribute is a valid URI of an existing resource.</li>
            <li>Check that the content at the target of that URI contains a long description describing the original non-text content associated with it.</li>
