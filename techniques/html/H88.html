            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to use HTML and XHTML according to their respective
               specifications. Technology specifications define the meaning and proper handling of
               features of the technology. Using those features in the manner described by the specification
               ensures that user agents, including assistive technologies, will be able to present
               representations of the feature that are accurate to the author's intent and interoperable
               with each other.
            </p>
            <p>At the time this technique was published, the appropriate versions of these technologies
               is HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0. HTML 4.01 is the latest mature version of HTML, which
               provides specific accessibility features and is widely supported by user agents. XHTML
               1.0 provides the same features as HTML 4.01, except that it uses an XML structure,
               and has a more strict syntax than the HTML structure. Later versions of these technologies
               are not mature and / or are not widely supported by user agents at this time.
            </p>
            <p>There are a few broad aspects to using HTML and XHTML according to their specification.</p>
            <ol>
               
               <li>
                  								       <strong>Using only features that are defined in the specification</strong> HTML defines sets of elements, attributes, and attribute values that may be used
                  on Web pages. These features have specific semantic meanings and are intended to be
                  processed by user agents in particular ways. Sometimes, however, additional features
                  come into common authoring practice. These are usually initially supported by only
                  one user agent. When features not in the specification are used, many user agents
                  may not support the feature for a while or ever. Furthermore, lacking standard specifications
                  for the use of these features, different user agents may provide varying support.
                  This impacts accessibility because assistive technologies, developed with fewer resources
                  than mainstream user agents, may take a long time if ever to add useful support. Therefore,
                  authors should avoid features not defined in HTML and XHTML to prevent unexpected
                  accessibility problems.
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  								       <strong>Using features in the manner prescribed by the specification</strong> The HTML specification provides specific guidance about how particular elements,
                  attributes, and attribute values are to be processed and understood semantically.
                  Sometimes, however, authors use features in a manner that is not supported by the
                  specification, for example, using semantic elements to achieve visual effects without
                  intending the underlying semantic message to be conveyed. This leads to confusion
                  for user agents and assistive technologies that rely on correct semantic information
                  to present a coherent representation of the page. It is important to use HTML features
                  only as prescribed by the HTML specification.
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  								       <strong>Making sure the content can be parsed</strong> HTML and XHTML also define how content should be encoded in order to be correctly
                  processed by user agents. Rules about the structure of start and end tags, attributes
                  and values, nesting of elements, etc. ensure that user agents will parse the content
                  in a way to achieve the intended document representation. Following the structural
                  rules in these specifications is an important part of using these technologies according
                  to specification.
