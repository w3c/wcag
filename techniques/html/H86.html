      <p>Before graphics became widely used on the internet, ASCII characters were often arranged to form pictures or graphs. Although ASCII art is not used frequently on the Web anymore, it must be remembered that, when it is used, it is very confusing to people who are blind and accessing the internet using screen readers. If it is used it should also have a text explanation of what the picture is. It is also suggested that there be a link to skip over the ASCII art (although this is not required).</p>
      <p>Emoticons are very popular. They include ASCII characters that form facial expressions and other ways to communicate an emotion. They can be confusing for screen reader users. When possible it is better simply to use a word like "smile" instead of an emoticon. But if emoticons are used they should have a text alternative. In some contexts, blog and forum software for example, plug-ins are available that automatically convert ASCII characters used as emoticons into HTML images with text alternatives.</p>
      <p>Leetspeak uses various combinations of characters, including numerals and special characters, to replace standard characters. Leet has become a part of Internet culture and slang. Leet is frequently used to beat text and spam filters. It is often incomprehensible to blind people using screen readers, and therefore requires a text alternative in order to conform to Success Criteria 1.1.1.</p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>Because support for this technique is limited, it is recommended that authors provide the text alternative in text. </p>

            <p>The following shows three options for providing alternatives for an emoticon representing "fright," which is made out of an equal sign followed by the number eight, a hyphen and the number zero.</p>

&lt;abbr title="fright"&gt;=8-0&lt;/abbr&gt;
