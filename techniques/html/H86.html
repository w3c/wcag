         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Emojis are very popular and are frequently used online to help provide more context and expression to text-based communication. Emojis come with their own pre-defined names that might not always match what the author is intending to communicate. For example, the emoji of a black right-facing triangle (‚ñ∫) is described by default as <i>black right-pointing pointer</i>, which would be confusing if a designer had changed its rotation or color, or if it was being used to give the accessible name to a "play" button in a multimedia player.</p>
         <p>Emoticons pre-date emojis, are still used but are much less popular than they once were. Emoticons use ASCII characters to create facial expressions and other ways to communicate an emotion. Because emoticons are made from many text characters, they can be confusing for screen reader users. When possible it is better simply to use a word like "smile" or a suitable emoji instead of an emoticon. If emoticons are used they should have a text alternative.</p>
         <p>ASCII art was common on the internet before graphics became widely used. ASCII characters were arranged to form pictures, pictures of text, or graphs. Although ASCII content is not used frequently on the Web anymore, it must be remembered that, when it is used, it can be very confusing to people who are accessing the internet using screen readers. If ASCII art is used, it should also have a text explanation of what the picture is. It is also suggested that, if the ASCII picture isn't marked up as an image using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr>, that there is a link to skip over the art (although this is not required).</p>

         <p>Leet used to be a fairly-common part of Internet culture and slang, but is now hardly used. Leetspeak uses various combinations of characters, including numerals and special characters, to replace standard characters. Leet is often incomprehensible to people using screen readers, and therefore requires a text alternative in order to conform to <a href="../../Understanding/non-text-content.html">Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-Text Content)</a>.</p>

         <h2>Examples</h2>
         <section class="example">
            <h3>Marking up emojis in a sentence</h3>
            <p>This shows a technique to mark up emojis with accessible names that differ from their default. Because you can't use an <code class="language-html">alt</code> attribute on a <code class="language-html">span</code> element and the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> recommendation disallows accessible names on generic elements, to give the emojis accessible names they are defined as images with the ARIA <code class="language-html">role="img"</code> property which then allows the creation of an accessible name using the <code class="language-html">aria-label</code> property.</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;I smiled at my friend and gestured 
   &lt;span aria-label="you" role="img"&gt;üëâüèæ&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span aria-label="rock" role="img"&gt;ü§òüèæ&lt;/span&gt;!

            <h3>Four options for providing alternatives for an emoticon representing "smile"</h3>
            <p>The following shows four options for providing alternatives for an emoticon representing "smile", which is consists of a colon followed by a closing parenthesis.</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">:) (smile)
