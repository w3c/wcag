         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>All HTML form fields that map to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes">HTML 5.2 autofill tokens</a>.
            </p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5: Identify Input Purpose</a> (Sufficient)</span>.
            </p>

         <section id="description">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to programmatically link a pre-defined and published
               taxonomic term to the input, so that the inputs can also be machine-interpreted. This
               way the input will always have a common, referable and identifiable value associated
               to it, no matter what language is used, or what visible on-screen term is used to
               label the input. Then it can be further customized or otherwise machine-manipulated
               to help users.
            </p>
            <p>The technique works by adding the appropriate autocomplete token to each form field
               on the form to make the identified inputs Programmatically Determinable. This will
               help people with cognitive disabilities who may not immediately know the purpose of
               the field because the label used by the author is not familiar to them.  When inputs
               have been programmatically assigned, third party plugins and software can manipulate
               these form fields to make them more accessible to people with cognitive disabilities.
               For instance, a plugin could detect an autocomplete token with the text string "tel"
               and insert a telephone icon. It will further enable third party software to swap out
               the existing labels for text labels that the user finds more familiar. For instance,
               it could change "Given Name" to "First Name".
            </p>
            <p>The <code>autocomplete</code> attribute also improves the browser's ability to pre-populate form fields with user-preferred
               values. When the input has been properly 'tagged' with the known token value, the
               value entered by the user is stored locally on the host machine and associated with
               the token value for reuse.  It helps those with dexterity disabilities who have trouble
               typing, those who may need more time, and anyone who wishes to reduce effort to fill
               out a form.
            </p>
            <p>The <code>autocomplete</code> attribute allows the browser to do a pattern match against a list of values locally
               stored with the browser, and supplies the appropriate corresponding value when the
               input is programmatically tagged. This is a User setting that can be turned on or
               off, or modified by the end user. This reduces typing and reliance on memory because
               it uses stored values to fill in the fields.
            </p>
            <p>It's important to note the success criterion <a href="identify-input-purpose">Identify Input Purpose</a> and autocomplete attribute only place requirements on input fields collecting information
               <em><strong>about the user</strong></em>.
            </p>
            <p>For the success criterion, it is assumed that the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute is not used on form fields that do not correspond to an autocomplete field
               described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#autofilling-form-controls-the-autocomplete-attribute">HTML 5.2 specification</a>. If the <code>autocomplete</code> field is used to describe a "custom" taxonomy, rather than that described in the
               specification, this rule may produce incorrect results.

               <h3>Security considerations</h3>
               				
               <p>Organizations can be concerned about allowing input fields to be automatically filled-in.
                  There is sometimes confusion about how browsers save information and the security
                  implications.
               </p>
               				
               <p>For the autocomplete attribute:</p>
               				
               <ul>
                  					
                  <li>This technique should only be used when asking for data about the <em>user</em> who is filling the form in, not for other people.
                  </li>
                  					
                  <li>It only works if you are on the same computer, using the same user-account, and using
                     the same browser. Any multi-login scenario does not save autocomplete data between
                     different accounts. (Users can setup syncing of data across computers, but that is
                     not the default.)
                  </li>
                  					
                  <li>Saving information with autocomplete is opt-in by the user, usually at the point of
                     saving data the first time.
                  </li>
                  					
                  <li>The form is not auto-submitted, the user can see the data before it is submitted.</li>
                  					
                  <li>It is easy to wipe both history and form data in the browser settings.</li>
                  					
                  <li>It is easy to engage a privacy mode, such as private browsing.</li>
                  					
                  <li>Even <em>without</em> autocomplete set in the webpage, browsers can save data, and some plugins (such as
                     password managers) will aggressively use heuristics to guess what fields are for and
                     fill them in. Using the autocomplete attribute makes those guesses accurate.
                  </li>
                  				
               </ul>
               				
               <p>The browser history provides far more detail about what people have done, and is just
                  as available as autocomplete data. The solutions/mitigations for browser-history are
                  similar to autocomplete.
