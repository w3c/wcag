         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>The objective of this technique is to avoid key errors that are known to cause problems for assistive technologies when they are trying to parse content which involve having opening and closing tags that are not used according to specification. There are several validators that a developer can use: validation reports generally mention these types of errors. This technique deals only with errors related to incorrectly formed opening and closing tags. The document type declaration is not strictly necessary for this type of evaluation, but specifying the document type declaration makes it easier to use a validator.</p>

            <section class="example">
               <h3>HTML</h3>
               <p>HTML pages include a document type declaration (sometimes referred to as <code class="language-html">!DOCTYPE</code> declaration). A developer can use offline or online validators (see the Resources section) to check that all <code class="language-html">id</code> attribute values are unique and that opening and closing tags are used according to the specification.</p>
