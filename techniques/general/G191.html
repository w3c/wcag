      <p>This technique relates to all technologies.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is a general technique for allowing people who cannot use a page with blinking content to turn the blinking content off.
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conf-req1">Conformance Requirement 1</a>
            allows for conforming alternate pages to be used to meet conformance. This technique is an example of that approach applied to success criteria 2.2.2.</p>
      <p>It is important that the page without blinking content contain all of the information that was on the page with blinking content.</p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>Removing the content that was blinking from the page would only be satisfactory if the blinking content was redundant with non blinking content in the original page.</p>
         <p>This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a
              <a>conforming alternate version</a>
              for non-conforming content. Refer to
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C29"></a>

      <ul>
         <li>A page has blinking text at the top warning users that they should not submit the page without first registering. A link at the very top of the page reloads the page with the blinking text replaced with text that is styled to be highly visible but does not blink.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Check that there is a mechanism to reload page to turn off blinking.</li>
            <li>Check that reloaded page has no blinking.</li>
            <li>Check that the reloaded page has all the information and functionality of the original page.</li>
