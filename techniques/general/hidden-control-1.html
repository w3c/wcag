         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that controls are visible without requiring
               the user hover with the mouse or another pointer device or move the keyboard focus
               to the control.  This is important when the user needs the control to progress or
               complete a process. Ensuring users can see the controls they need prevents users from
               having to search for controls and remember where they are located. This improves success
               for individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities and memory impairments.
            </p>
            <p>To meet this technique use controls that are visible without onmouseover or onfocus
               events. 
            </p>
            <p>Some pages may appear cluttered when the same control is repeated in multiple places
               on the page. Often in these cases, the control is not needed to progress but is functioning
               as a shortcut through the process. If the control is provided in a later step when
               it is needed to progress, then these shortcuts do not need to be displayed.
            </p>

               <h3>Procedure</h3>
               <p>For controls that progress or complete a process:</p>
               <ol>
                  					
                  <li>Verify that the controls are visible at the time they are needed without requiring
                     pointer hover or keyboard focus.
                  </li>
                  				
               </ol>
               <p>Note: Where a page has multiple page variations (i.e., in a responsive design) controls
                  should be tested in each variation.
