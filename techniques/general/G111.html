      <p>All technologies that support images.</p>

      <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that when color differences are used to convey information within non-text content, patterns are included to convey the same information in a manner that does not depend on color.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>A real estate site provides a bar chart of average housing prices in several regions of the United States. The bar for each region is displayed with a different solid color and a different pattern. The legend uses the same colors and patterns to identify each bar.</p>

            <p>An on-line map of a transportation system displays each route in a different color. The stops on each route are marked with a distinctive icon such as a diamond, square, or circle to help differentiate each route.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>A flow chart describes a set of iterative steps to complete a process. It uses dashed, arrowed lines with a green background to point to the next step in the process when the specified condition passes. It uses dotted arrowed lines with a red background to point to the next step in the process when the specified condition fails.</p>

         <p>For each image within the Web page that use color differences to convey information:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Check that all information that is conveyed using color is also conveyed using patterns that do not rely on color.</li>
