            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <p>All technologies.</p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/error-prevention-legal-financial-data">Success Criterion 3.3.4: Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)</a> (Sufficient)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This technique is to seek confirmation from the user that the selected action is his
               or her intended action. Use this technique in situations where the action can not
               be undone after it has been followed through. This will help users avoid submitting
               a form or deleting data by mistake.
            </p>
            <p>For example, this may occur when the user expects the 'submit' and 'cancel' buttons
               to occur in an order contrary to what is provided and selects a button too quickly
               to notice the unexpected order. Presenting the user with a confirmation request allows
               the user to recognize the error and either stop the submission of data or stop the
               loss of entered data.
            </p>
            <p>The request for confirmation should inform the user of the action that was selected
               and the consequences of continuing with the action.

               <h3>Example 1: Airline travel</h3>
               <p>An online travel Web site lets users create travel itineraries that reserve seats
                  with different airlines. Users may look up, amend and cancel their current itineraries.
                  If the user needs to cancel his travel plans, he finds the itinerary on the Web page
                  and deletes it from his list of current itineraries. This action results in the cancellation
                  of his seat reservations and is not reversible. The user is informed that the selected
                  action will cancel their current seat reservations and that it may not be possible
                  to make a comparable booking on the same flights once this action has been taken.
                  The user is asked to confirm or cancel the deletion of the itinerary.

               <h3>Example 2: Webmail</h3>
               <p>A Webmail application stores a user's email on a server, so that it can be accessed
                  from anywhere on the web. When a user deletes an email message, it is moved to a trash
                  folder from which it can be retrieved if it was deleted by accident. There is an "empty
                  trash" command for deleting the messages in the trash folder from the server. Once
                  the trash folder has been emptied, the messages can no longer be retrieved. Before
                  emptying the trash folder, the user is asked to confirm or cancel deletion of the
                  email in the trash folder.

               <h3>Example 3: An online test</h3>
               <p>A form is used to collect answers for a test. When the 'submit' or 'reset' button
                  is selected the user is presented with a web page that informs them of their choice
                  and asks for confirmation to continue. Example 1: "You have selected to reset the
                  form. This will delete all previously entered data and will not submit any answers.
                  Would you like to reset the form? [yes button] [no button]" Example 2: "You have selected
                  to submit the form. This will submit entered data as your final answers and can not
                  be changed. Would you like to submit the form? [yes button] [no button]"

               <h3>Example 4: Trading stocks</h3>
               <p>A brokerage site allows users to buy and sell stocks and other securities. If the
                  user makes a transaction during trading hours, a dialog is presented informing the
                  user that the transaction is immediate and irreversible, and has buttons that say
                  "continue" and "cancel."
