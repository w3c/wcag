      <p>Any technology that produces visual output.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
            that is presented over a background. This technique goes beyond the 4.5:1
            contrast technique to provide a higher level of contrast to make it easier
            for people with low vision to read.</p>
      <p>If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the
            contrast ratio of the text can be maintained by making sure that each
            of the text letters have a 7:1 contrast ratio with the background.</p>
      <p>If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned), then
            the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the
            letters maintain a 7:1 contrast ratio with the background behind them
            even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background.</p>
      <p>The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the
            relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes across
            the page.</p>
      <p>Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the
            necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not
            normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.</p>
   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>A black background is chosen so that light colored
                letters that match the company's logo can be used.</li>
         <li>Text is placed over a picture of the college campus.
                Since a wide variety of colors and darknesses appear in the picture
                the area behind the text is fogged white so that the picture is very
                faint and the maximum darkness is still light enough to maintain a
                7:1 contrast ratio with the black text written over the picture.</li>

      <p class="note">Before May 2021 the value of 0.04045 in the definition was different (0.03928). It was taken from an older version of the specification and has been updated. It has no practical effect on the calculations in the context of these guidelines.</p>
