         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to allow authors to include sound behind
               speech without making it too hard for people with hearing problems to
               understand the speech. Making sure that the foreground speech is 20 db louder than
               the
               backgound sound makes the speech 4 times louder than the background audio.

               <h3>Example 2: Sufficient audio contrast between a narrator and background music</h3>
               <p>This example demonstrates a voice with music in the background in which the voice
                  is the appropriate 20 DB above the background. The voice (foreground) is recorded
                  at -17.52 decibels (average RMS) and the music (background) is at -37.52 decibels,
                  which makes the foreground 20 decibels louder than the background.

               <p class="exsubhead">Audio example of the failure</p>
               <p>This example demonstrates a voice with music in the background in which the voice
                  is not 20 DB above the background. The voice (foreground) is at -18 decibels and the
                  music (background) is at about -16 decibels making the foreground only 2 decibels
                  louder than the background.

               <p>Transcript of audio example (bad contrast):</p>
               <p>"This is an example of a voice that is not loud enough against the background. The
                  voice which is the foreground is only about 2 decibels above the background. Therefore
                  is difficult to understand for a person who is hard of hearing. It is hard to discern
                  one word from the next. This is an example of what not to do."

               <p class="exsubhead">Visual example of the failure</p>
               <p>The highlighted section contains foreground and background. The wave is almost the
                  same size the section that contains only background, which means the background is
                  too loud in comparison to the foreground voice.
