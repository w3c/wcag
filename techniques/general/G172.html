      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a version of the page that does not have full justification (justified both left and right).</p>
      <p>There may be circumstances when for layout purposes an author may want to have the text fully justified. In these cases, it is sufficient to provide a feature that removes the justification of text. The control should be easy to find and access and near the beginning of the page.</p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a
              <a>conforming alternate version</a>
              for non-conforming content. Refer to

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>A classic novel online is on a site that attempts to duplicate the look of the originally published work, which includes full justification. A button is provided near the top of the page saying "remove full justification" and a style switching technique is used to swap out the style sheet. The new style sheet aligns the text only on the left.</p>
