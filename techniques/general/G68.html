   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This technique provides a short text alternative for Live audio-only and live video-only content. This text may be used in combination with a full text alternative for time-based media (for audio or video), or in combination with audio description (for video).
            Those alternatives, however, are not part of this technique. The purpose of
            this technique is to ensure that the user can determine what the non-text
            content is, even if they cannot access it. NOTE: Even if full alternatives
            are also available, it is important that users be able to identify the
            non-text content when they encounter it so that they are not confused, and
            so that they can associate it with the full alternative when they encounter
            it.</p>
