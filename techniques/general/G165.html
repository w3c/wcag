            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Operating systems have a native indication of focus, which is available in many user
               agents. The default rendering of the focus indicator isn't always highly visible and
               may even be difficult to see against certain backgrounds. However, many platforms
               allow the user to customize the rendering of this focus indicator. Assistive technology
               can also change the appearance of the native focus indicator. If you use the native
               focus indicator, any system-wide settings for its visibility will carry over to the
               Web page. If you draw your own focus indicator, for example by coloring sections of
               the page in response to user action, these settings will not carry over, and AT will
               not usually be able to find your focus indicator.

               <h3>Example 1</h3>
               <p>The default focus indicator on Microsoft Windows is a one-pixel, black dotted line
                  around the focused element. On a page with a dark background, this can be very difficult
                  to see. The creator of the page uses the default, and the user customizes it in Windows
                  to make it a bright color.

               <h3>Example 2</h3>
               <p>In HTML, form elements and links can be focused by default. In addition, any element
                  with a tabindex attribute &gt;= 0 can take focus. Both types of focused elements use
                  the system focus indicator and will pick up platform changes in the focus indicator
                  style.
