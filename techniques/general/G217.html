            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Some authors provide shortcuts in their applications to allow for faster user interaction.
               However, where such shortcuts involve only character keys (letters, numbers, punctuation
               or symbol characters) without modifiers, they create challenges for speech input users
               as well as some keyboard users who lack the ability to type accurately.
            </p>
            <p>To prevent accidental activation, authors must allow users to turn off or reconfigure
               shortcuts that are made up of only character keys. Reconfiguring the shortcut may
               involve the ability to add a modifier key such as Ctrl, or authors may elect to allow
               users to alter the character keys assigned in addition to adding a modifer. Providing
               a mechanism to turn off or reassign the shortcut ensures more users can successfully
               interact with the application.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>If the keyboard shortcut is only active when a particular user interface component
                  has focus, then the author does not need to provide an override mechanism. For example,
                  in a <code>select</code> element, it is expected behaviour that pressing a letter key will reposition to the
                  next item within the select element that begins with that character. This shortcut
                  is only triggered when the select element has focus, and so it does not interfere
                  with a user's ability to interact with the rest of the page.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>An initial challenge for testers is identifying if author-created shortcuts exist,
               and then determining if existing shortcuts are triggered by character keys without
               modifiers. Where testers have access to the develop team, the existence and nature
               of shortcut keys can often be determined simply by asking involved designers and developers.
               Where reliable information from the authors is not available, the presence of shortcuts
               can possibly be identified by checking code (for example, in javascript, the presence
               of <code>keydown</code>, <code>keyup</code> and <code>keypress</code> listeners). Another means of identifying shortcuts is to review documentation. Where
               none of these strategies provide information on the presence of keyboard shortcuts,
               manual tests will need to be completed to search for the existence of character key
               shortcuts. Review the test procedure in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/failures/F99">F99: Failure of Success Criterion 2.1.4 due to implementing character key shortcuts that
                  cannot be turned off or remapped</a> for guidance.

            <section class="example" id="example-1-author-provides-a-simple-mechanism-to-disable-shortcuts-in-a-web-based-email-client">
               <h3>Example 1: Author provides a simple mechanism to disable shortcuts in a web-based
                  email client
               </h3>
               <p>An email client contains single-character shortcuts so that keyboard users can more
                  rapidly interact with the application (e.g., the R key replies to the current item
                  in the inbox, the D key deletes it, the S key stars it). These keys do not apply while
                  users are composing emails; however, users may become confused about whether the keyboard
                  focus is in a compose pane or the inbox and, while in the inbox, inadvertently delete
                  a message by trying to compose a word containing the letter D. To overcome this problem,
                  the author provides a toggle button for the shortcuts, allowing users to easily turn
                  them off or on.

               <h3>Example 2: Author provides a menu option where users can remap shortcuts</h3>
               <p>A web-based application has single-character shortcuts for functions which are different
                  than those a user regularly uses with a software application installed locally. Since
                  the author has provided a menu where the user can reassign both the shortcut keys
                  and the modifiers, the user is able to reassign the shortcut to a familiar combination.
