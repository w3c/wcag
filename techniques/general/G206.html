            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>There may be situations where an author needs to use a layout that requires horizontal
               scrolling. In that case, it is sufficient to provide options within the content that
               switch to a layout that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a
               line of text. This may be achieved using standard style switching technology. 
            </p>
            <p>It should be noted that it is also sufficient to lay out the content in such a way
               that horizontal scrolling is required to access content, but that it is not necessary
               to scroll horizontally in order to read a line of text.
            </p>
            <p>For instance, a spreadsheet that requires horizontal scrolling is acceptable if no
               horizontal scrolling is necessary for each column individually (i.e., scrolling is
               only necessary to see other columns, but not for the left or right edges of each individual
               column).
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present
                     a page that is a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#dfn-conforming-alternate-version" target="terms">conforming alternate version</a> for non-conforming content.

               <p>A real estate company has an online annual report that has an identical layout to
                  that of their print version, and as such, requires horizontal scrolling to read a
                  line of text. A control is on the page that switches the stylesheet and provides a
                  layout that does not require horizontal scrolling.

               <p>A financial spreadsheet is online. It includes text explaining changes in the housing
                  market in January. Off-screen to the right, there is a column with an explanation
                  of changes to the market in September. The user can horizontally scroll to the September
                  area and read each line of text without any further scrolling when the window size
                  is maximized.
