			<h2>When to Use</h2>
      <p>Any markup languages and many other technologies.</p>
   </section>
	 <section id="description">
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The objective of this technique is to avoid ambiguities in Web pages that often result from code that does not validate against formal specifications. Each technology's mechanism to specify the technology and technology version is used, and the Web page is validated against the formal specification of that technology. If a validator for that technology is available, the developer can use it.</p>
    <p>Validation will usually eliminate ambiguities (and more) because an essential step in validation is to check for proper use of that technology's markup (in a markup language) or code (in other technologies). Validation does not necessarily check for full conformance with a specification but it is the best means for automatically checking content against its specification.</p>

		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<section class="example">
			<h3>Validating <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></h3>
			<p>HTML pages include a document type declaration (sometimes referred to as <code class="language-html">!DOCTYPE</code> statement) and are valid according to the HTML version specified by the document type declaration. The developer can use off-line or online validators (see <a href="#resources">Resources section</a>) to check the validity of the HTML pages.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="example">
			<h3>Validating <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr></h3>
			<p><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>, <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> and other XML-based documents reference a Document Type Definition (DTD) or other type of XML schema. The developer can use online or off-line validators (including validation tools built into editors) to check the validity of the XML documents.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="example">
			<h3>Batch validation with Ant</h3>
      <p>The <code class="language-html">xmlvalidate</code> task of Apache Ant can be used for batch validation of XML files. The following Apache Ant target is a simple example for the validation of files with the extension .xml in the directory <code>dev\\Web</code> (relative to the Ant build file).</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-xml">&lt;target name="validate-xml"&gt; 
  &lt;xmlvalidate lenient="no"&gt; 
    &lt;fileset dir="dev/web" includes="*.xml" /&gt; 
  &lt;/xmlvalidate&gt; 
&lt;/target&gt;</code></pre>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>For HTML, <abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr>-based and XML-based technologies:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Load each page or document into a validating parser.</li>
            <li>Check that no validation errors are found.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>For other technologies:</p>
         <p>Follow the validation procedure defined for the technology in use, if any exists.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <p>For HTML, SGML-based and XML-based technologies:</p>
         <p>Check #2 is true.</p>
