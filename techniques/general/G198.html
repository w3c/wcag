      <p>This technique relates to all technologies.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for people who cannot complete tasks within a specified time limit to turn off the time limit.</p>
      <p>It is essential that the mechanism for turning off the time limit can be completed without a time limit itself and before the time limit for the page expires. To do this - the mechanism should be available at or near the top of the page so that it can be found and activated quickly by people with a wide range of disabilities.</p>
   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>A page has a listing of news headlines that automatically update every minute. At the top of the page is a link that turns off the updating.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Check that there is a mechanism to turn off any time limits near the top of the page.</li>
            <li>Verify that the time limit for the page is long enough that a user can easily navigate to the mechanism even if they are 10 times slower than most users.</li>
         </ol>
