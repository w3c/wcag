      <p>Pages that open new windows and tabs</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to limit the use of links or buttons that open new windows or tabs within web content. In general, it is better not to open new windows and tabs since they can be disorienting for people, especially people who have difficulty perceiving visual content (and who may therefore not realize that a new window or tab was opened). However there are some situations where it is preferable from an accessibility perspective to open a new window or tab. Here are two such situations:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Opening a page containing context-sensitive information, such as help instructions, will significantly disrupt a multi-step workflow, such as filling in and submitting a form, if the page is opened in the same window or tab.</li>
         <li>The user is logged into a secured area of a site, and following a  link to a page outside of the secured area would terminate the user's logon. In this case opening external links in an external window allows  the user to access such references while keeping their login active in  the original window.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It is recommended that when links are opened to a new window, there is advance warning.</p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Online Form</h3>
         
            <p>An online form provides extensive context-sensitive help for each form field on a separate page because there is too much text to include within the form. The links to the context-sensitive help open in new windows or tabs to prevent the loss of any form data that has already been entered.</p>

         <h3>Secure website</h3>
         
            <p>A page on a secure website includes a link to an external page that  is outside of the secure session. The link opens in a new window or tab  since opening the link in the same window will break or destroy the  secure session.</p>

         <h3>Document link</h3>
         
            <p>A page presenting substantial content includes a link to a supporting document provided in another format (PDF). The document opens in a new tab to allow users to consult the additional material while preserving their current context and progress on the originating page.</p>
