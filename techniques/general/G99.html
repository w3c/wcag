            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>When a Web application provides the capability of deleting information, the server
               can provide a means to recover information that was deleted in error by a user. One
               approach is to delay deleting the data by merely marking it for deletion or moving
               it to a holding area (such as a trash can) and waiting some period of time before
               actually deleting it. During this time period, the user can request that the data
               be restored or can retrieve it from the holding area. Another approach is to record
               all delete transactions in such a way that data can be restored if requested by the
               user, such as in the edit history stored by wikis and source control applications.The
               retrievable information that is stored should be that which would be needed to correct
               the transaction.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A Web application allows users to set up folders and store data within them. Each
                  folder and data item is accompanied by a checkbox to mark it for action, and two buttons,
                  one to move and one to delete. If the user selects the delete button by mistake, large
                  amounts of data could be lost. The application presents the data as deleted to the
                  user right away, but schedules it for actual deletion in one week. During the week,
                  the user may go into a "deleted items" folder and request any folder or data item
                  awaiting actual deletion to be restored.
