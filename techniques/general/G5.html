      <p>This technique applies to any technologies or methods supporting the implementation of an activity which does not require timed interaction for its functionality.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide users with all the time they need to complete an activity. This technique involves providing a specified activity which does not require timed interaction. Users are allowed as much time as they need to interact with the activity.</p>
   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>An interactive exam for a course provides all questions on one Web page. Users can take as much time as they need to complete it.</li>
         <li>In an interactive game, users can take as much time as they like on their turn instead of having to complete their move within a limited amount of time.</li>
         <li>In an online auction, each bidder can submit only one bid rather than submitting multiple competitive bids based on timing. The bidding is open for a full day, providing enough time for anyone to complete the simple bid form. Once bidding is closed, the best bid wins.</li>
      </ul>
