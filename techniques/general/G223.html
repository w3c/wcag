    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <section class="example">
       <h3>Links</h3>

    <section class="example">
       <h3>Form Elements</h3>
       
          <p>A Web page includes a form inside a table. The borders of both the table and the form elements are thin, black lines. When focus lands on a form element, the element is outlined with a 5 pixel red line that is partially transparent. The red is equivalent to a hex color of #CA0000, providing a 6:1 contrast ratio with the white background.</p>

    <section class="example">
       <h3>Menus</h3>
       
          <p>A Web page includes an interactive menu with sub-menus. A user can move focus in the menu using the arrow keys. As focus moves, the currently focused menu item changes its background to a different color, which has a 15:1 contrast ratio with the surrounding items (whilst maintaining text contrast).</p>
