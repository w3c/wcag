            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>General technique. Applies to all technologies.</p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded">Success Criterion 1.2.1: Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)</a> (Sufficient)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting
               the information in an audio-only presentation.
            </p>
            <p>In an audio-only presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including
               dialogue and sounds (both natural and artificial). In order to present the same information
               in accessible form, this technique involves creating a document that tells the same
               story and presents the same information as the prerecorded audio-only content. In
               this technique, the document serves as long description for the content and includes
               all of the important dialogue and as well as descriptions of background sounds etc.
               that are part of the story.
            </p>
            <p>If an actual script was used to create the audio-only content in the first place,
               this can be a good place to start. In production and editing however, the content
               often varies somewhat from the script. For this technique, the original script would
               be corrected to match the dialogue and what actually happens in the final edited form
               of the audio presentation.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A podcast includes a description of new features in a recent software release. It
                  involves two speakers informally discussing the new and updated features and describing
                  how they are used. One of the speakers works from a list of questions that was used
                  to outline the discussion prior to recording. After the recording is complete, the
                  outline is then edited and supplemented to match the dialogue etc. The resulting transcript
                  is then made available on the speakers Web site along with the audio-only file. The
                  text alternative that identifies the audio only content reads, "Episode 42: Zap Version
                  12 (text transcript follows)" and the link to the transcript is provided immediately
                  following the audio-only content.
