      <p>Any technology where text and background color are specified
            separately and browsers can control default colors.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
            that is presented over a background. With this technique the author avoids
            having to do any contrast measures by simply not specifying the text color
            and not specifying the background. As a result the colors of both are
            completely determined by the user agent.</p>
      <p>Some people who have vision disabilities set their user agent to override certain colors that they have trouble seeing. This technique will help avoid a situation where the user agent and web site conflict with each other over the foreground and/or background colors resulting in the same color for text and background, which would make it invisible for user who set their own colors in their browser or Assistive Technology.</p>
   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <section class="example">
         
            <p>The author specifies neither text color nor background, and does not use CSS. As a result the user can set their browser
                defaults to provide the colors and contrasts that work well for
                them.</p>
