      <p>Programming technologies that have standard components programmed to interface with accessibility APIs.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to allow assistive technology to
            understand Web content so that it can convey equivalent information to the
            user through an alternate user interface.</p>
      <p>Sometimes content is not created using markup language but rather using a
            programming language or tools. In many cases, these technologies have
            interface components that are already programmed to interface with
            accessibility APIs. If an author uses these components and fills in the
            properties (e.g., name, etc.), the resulting user interface components in the
            content will be accessible to assistive technology.</p>
      <p>However, if an author wants to create a user interface component that is new
            and they cannot use standard components, then they need to be sure to add
            the accessibility provisions themselves - and implement them in a way that
            is compatible with the accessibility API.</p>
      <p>After completion, the custom component should be tested for Accessibility Support.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>A Web page uses java to create an applet. A group of
                authors wants to create an entirely new type of interface component
                so they cannot use existing Java objects. They use Java swing classes
                to create their component because the Java swing classes already
                have provisions for connecting to different accessibility APIs.
                Using the Java swing classes they are able to create an interface
                component that exposes its name and role, is able to be set by AT
                and alerts AT to any updates.</li>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Render content using an accessible User Agent.</li>
            <li>Use an Accessibility Tool designed for the Accessibility API of the User agent to evaluate each user interface component.</li>
            <li>Check that name and role for each user interface component is found by the tool.</li>
            <li>Change the values on the component.</li>
            <li>Check that the Accessibility tool is alerted.</li>
            <li>Check that the component works with assistive technologies.</li>
         </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Checks #3, #5 and #6 are true for each user interface component.</li>
