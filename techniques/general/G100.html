      <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users to identify the non-text
            content even if the non-text content is intended to provide a specific
            sensory experience. For example, a deaf person may want to know what an
            audio instrumental file is - even if they cannot hear it. Similarly, a blind
            person may want to know what the subject of a visual image is - even if they
            cannot see it.</p>
