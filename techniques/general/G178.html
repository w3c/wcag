            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide a mechanism on the Web page to incrementally
               increase the size of text. Many people with low vision do not use magnifying software,
               and they may not be familiar with their browser's text size adjustments. This may
               be particularly true of older people who are learning about computers later in life
               and who may be experiencing age related vision loss. It may also be true of some people
               with cognitive disabilities who require increased font size.
            </p>
            <p>This technique provides a mechanism that some users will find easier to use. The mechanism
               may include links or buttons that will switch the visual presentation to a different
               style sheet or use scripts to change the text size dynamically.
            </p>
            <p>To implement this technique, an author provides controls that allow the user to incrementally
               increase or decrease the text size of all of the text on the page to a size that is
               at least 200% of the default text size.
            </p>
            <p>This can be achieved by providing links, buttons or linked images and the controls
               themselves should be as easy to find (e.g. prominently positioned within the page,
               presented in a larger text size, high contrast, etc.) as possible.
            </p>
            <p>This technique can also be used in circumstances where scalable fonts cannot be used,
               such as legacy code situations.

               <div>
                  
                  <p>This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present
                     a page that is a

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A newspaper article has two buttons near the top of the page. The "increase text size"
                  button has a big letter "T" with an upward arrow and the "decrease text size" button
                  has a small letter "T" with a down arrow. There is
                  <code class="att">alt</code>
                  text on each button.
               </li>
               
               <li>A site has a number of style sheets with different text size. The user can choose
                  any of the style sheets if their browser provides this functionality. Each page also
                  includes the links "Increase text size" and "Decrease text size" that will change
                  the style sheet currently applied to the appropriate alternate style sheet.
               </li>
               
               <li>A site includes the text "Change text size:" followed by text links "Up" and "Down"
                  on every Web page. The links trigger a Javascript that alters the value of the text-size
                  property accordingly.
               </li>
               
               <li>A site includes a link on every page that reads "Change text size." The resulting
                  page includes a series of links that includes options representing the available sizes.
                  The links read, "Smallest font size," "Small font size," "Default font size," "Large
                  font size," etc. Instructions preceding the list direct users to choose a link to
                  change to the desired font size.
