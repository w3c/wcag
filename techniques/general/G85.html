            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide assistance in correcting input errors
               where the information supplied by the user is not accepted. When users enter data
               input that is validated, and input errors are detected, information about the nature
               and location of the input error is provided in text to enable the users to identify
               the problem. One approach is to use client-side validation and provide an alert dialog
               box that describes the error immediately when users enter invalid data in field. Another
               approach, using server-side validation, is to re-display the form (including any previously
               entered data), and a text description at the top of the page that indicates the fact
               that there was an error, describes the nature of the problem, and provides ways to
               easily locate the field(s) with a problem.
            </p>
            <p>However the text description is provided, it should do one of the following things
               to assist the user:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Provide examples of the correct data entry for the field,</li>
               
               <li>Describe the correct data entry for the field,</li>
               
               <li>Show values of the correct data entry that are similar to the user's data entry, with
                  instructions to the user as to how to enter one of these correct values should the
                  user choose to do so.
               </li>

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>The user inputs invalid data on a form field. When the user exits the field, an alert
                  dialog appears that describes the nature of the error so the user can fix it.
               </li>
               
               <li>The user inputs invalid data on a form field and submits the form. The server returns
                  the form, with the user's data still present, and indicates clearly in text at the
                  top of the page that there were input errors. The text describes the nature of the
                  error(s) and clearly indicates which field had the problem so the user can easily
                  navigate to it to fix the problem.
               </li>
               
               <li>The user inputs invalid data on a form field and attempts to submit the form. Client
                  side scripting detects the error, cancels the submit, and modifies the document to
                  provide a text description after the submit button describing the error, with links
                  to the field(s) with the error. The script also modifies the labels of the fields
                  with the problems to highlight them.
