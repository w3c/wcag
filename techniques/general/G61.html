      <p>The objective of this technique is to make content easier to use by making
            the placement of repeated components more predictable. This technique helps
            maintain consistent layout or presentation between Web pages by presenting components that are repeated in these Web  units in the same relative order each time they appear. Other
            components can be inserted between them, but their relative order is not
            changed.</p>
      <p>This technique also applies to navigational components that are repeated.
            Web pages often contain a navigation menu or other
            navigational component that allows the user to jump to other Web pages. This technique makes the placement of navigational
            components more predictable by presenting the links or programmatic
            references inside a navigational component in the same relative order each
            time the navigational component is repeated. Other links can be removed or
            inserted between the existing ones, for example to allow navigation inside a
            subsection of a set of Web pages, but the relative order is not
            changed.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>A Web site has a logo, a title, a search form and a navigation bar
                at the top of each page; these appear in the same relative order on
                each page where they are repeated. On one page the search form is
                missing but the other items are still in the same order.</li>
         <li>A Web site has a left-hand navigation menu with links to the major
                sections of the site. When the user follows a link to another
                section of the site, the links to the major sections appear in the
                same relative order in the next page. Sometime links are dropped and
                other links are added, but the other links always stay in the same
                relative order. For example, on a Web site of a company that sells
                products and offers training, when a user moves from the section on
                products to the section on training, the links to individual
                products are removed from the navigation list, while links to
                training offerings are added.</li>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>List components that are repeated on each Web page in a set
                  of Web pages (for example, on each page in a Web site).</li>
            <li>For each component, check that it appears in the same relative
                  order with regard to other repeated components on each Web page where it appears.</li>
            <li>For each navigational component, check that the links or
                  programmatic references are always in the same relative order.</li>
