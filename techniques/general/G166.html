			<h2>When to Use</h2>
      <p>All technologies that can contain video content</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Video-only content is inaccessible to people who are blind and to some who have low vision. Therefore, it is important for them to have an audio alternative. One way of doing this is to provide an audio track describing the information in the video. The audio should be a common audio format used on the internet, such as MP3.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
      <section class="example">
				<p>A Web page has a link to a video-only presentation of a spaceship landing on Mars. The link to the video is a picture of a spaceship. Near the video is a link to an audio file of a person describing the video. This would look something like the following code example in HTML.</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-html">&lt;a href="../video/marslanding.mp4"&gt;
  &lt;img src="../images/spaceship.jpg" alt="Mars landing, video-only"
   width="193" height="255"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mars-landing-audio.mp3"&gt;Audio description of "Mars Landing"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
