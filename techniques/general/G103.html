         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide visual illustrations that help users
               with reading disabilities understand difficult text that describes concepts or processes.
               The illustrations are provided in addition to the text.
            </p>
            <p>Users with disabilities that make it difficult to decode words and sentences are likely
               to have trouble reading and understanding complex text. Charts, diagrams,
               animations, photographs, graphic organizers, or other visual materials often help
               these users. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Charts and graphs help users understand complex data.</li>
               
               <li>Diagrams, flowcharts, videos, and animations help users understand processes.</li>
               
               <li>Concept maps and other graphic organizers help users understand how ideas are related
                  to each other.
               </li>
               
               <li>Photographs, drawings, and videos can help users understand natural or historical
                  events or objects.

               <h3>Example 1: An annual report for a company</h3>
               <p>An annual report discusses multiple factors that influenced the company's performance
                  in the past year. The report also includes charts and graphs that illustrate how these
                  factors interact. Each chart or graph has a text alternative as required by
                  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content">Success Criterion 1.1.1</a>. Each one also has a number in its caption (e.g., “Figure 7"). These numbers are
                  used in the text to reference the charts or graphs.

               <p>Online documentation for a product includes step by step instructions. Each step is

               <h3>Example 3: Illustrations of a complex natural event</h3>
               <p>A Web site discusses the tsunami of 2004. The site describes how the tsunami affected
                  different places around the Indian Ocean. Photographs of the devastation in each area
                  are included. Each photograph has a text alternative as required by Success Criterion
                  1.1.1. The site also explains what happens underwater during a tsunami. The explanation
                  is accompanied by an animation that shows how a tsunami occurs and spreads over the
                  ocean. The animation has a text alternative as required by Success Criterion 1.1.1.
