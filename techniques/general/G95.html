      <p>This technique is used when the text needed to serve the same purpose and
            present the same information as the original non-text content is too lengthy
            or when this goal cannot be achieved with text alone. In that case this
            technique is used to provide a short text alternative that briefly describes
            the non-text content. (A long text alternative is then provided using
            another technique such that the combination serves the same purpose and
            presents the same information as the original non-text content.)</p>
      <p>In deciding what text to include in the alternative, it is often a good idea
            to consider the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Why is this non-text content here?</li>
         <li>What information is it presenting?</li>
         <li>What purpose does it fulfill?</li>
         <li>If I could not use the non-text content, what words would I use to
                convey the same function and/or information?</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
         <li>A chart showing sales for October has an short text
                alternative of "October sales chart". It also has a long
                description that provides all of the information on the
                chart.</li>
