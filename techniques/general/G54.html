         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.2 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique,
            and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology
            can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.2.

            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>Applies to all technologies that present synchronized media information</p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/sign-language-prerecorded">Success Criterion 1.2.6: Sign Language (Prerecorded)</a> (Sufficient)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear or read text rapidly
               to be able to access synchronized media material.
            </p>
            <p>For those who communicate primarily in sign language it is sometimes less preferable
               and sometimes not possible for them to read and understand text at the rate it is
               presented in captions.   For these latter individuals it is important to provide sign
               language presentation of the audio information.
            </p>
            <p>One universally compatible way of doing this is to simply embed a video of the sign
               language interpreter in the video stream.   This has the disadvantage of providing
               a lower resolution image that cannot be easily enlarged without enlarging the entire
               image.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>If the video stream is too small, the sign language interpreter will be indiscernible.
                     When creating a video stream that includes a video of a sign language interpreter,
                     make sure there is a mechanism to play the video stream full screen in the accessibility-supported
                     content technology. Otherwise, be sure the interpreter portion of the video is adjustable
                     to the size it would be had the entire video stream been full screen.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Since sign language is not usually a signed version of the printed language, the author
                     has to decide which sign language to include.  Usually the sign language of the primary
                     audience would be used.  If intended for multiple audiences, multiple sign languages
                     may be used.  Refer to advisory techniques for multiple sign languages.
