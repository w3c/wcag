      <p>All technologies that contain links</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a list of links to all the web pages in the set on each web page. It is one of a series of techniques for locating content that are sufficient for addressing Success Criterion 2.4.5. 
            This technique is only effective for small sets of web pages; if the list of links is longer than the rest of the content in the web page, it may make the web page more difficult for users to understand and use.</p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>Success Criterion 2.4.1 requires a technique for skipping this list of links.</p>
