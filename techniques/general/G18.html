            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
               that is presented over a background. For Success Criterion 1.4.3, this technique describes
               the minimum contrast ratio for text that is less than 18 point (if not bold) and less
               than 14 point (if bold). For Success Criterion 1.4.5, this technique relaxes the 7:1
               contrast ratio requirement  for text that is at least 18 point (if not bold) or at
               least 14 point (if bold).
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>When evaluating this success criterion, the font size in points should be obtained
                     from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way that user agents do.
                     Point sizes are based on the CSS pt size <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-lengths">CSS3 Values</a>. The ratio between sizes in points and CSS pixels is 1pt = 1.333px, therefore 14pt
                     and 18pt are equivalent to approximately 18.5px and 24px.
                  </p>
                  
               </div>
            </div>
            <p>If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the
               relative luminance of the text can be maintained by making sure that each
               of the text letters have 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background.
            </p>
            <p>If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned) then
               the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the
               letters maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background behind them
               even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background.
            </p>
            <p>For example, if a letter is lighter at the top than it is a the bottom, it may be
               difficult to maintain the contrast ratio between the letter and the background over
               the full letter. In this case, the designer might darken the background behind the
               letter, or add a thin black outline (at least one pixel wide) around the letter in
               order to keep the contrast ratio between the letter and the background above 4.5:1.
            </p>
            <p>The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the
               relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes
               across
               the page.
            </p>
            <p>For example, if a page is very light on one edge and fades to very dark on the other
               edge, there is no color that can run across the page and meet the contrast guidelines
               on both edges. One way of addressing this would be to change the lightness of the
               letters as well so that each letter always meets the contrast ratio for the background
               that is immediately behind the letter.
            </p>
            <p>Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the
               necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not
               normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.

               <li>A black background is chosen so that light colored letters that match the company
                  logo can be used.

                  <p>Text is placed over a picture of the college campus.
                     Since a wide variety of colors and shades appear in the picture,
                     the area behind the text is fogged white so that the picture is very
                     faint and the maximum darkness is still light enough to maintain a
                     4.5:1 contrast ratio with the black text written over the picture.
