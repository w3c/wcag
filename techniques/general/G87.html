      <p>Any audiovideo technology where there are user agents that support closed
            captions.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a way for people who have
            hearing impairments or otherwise have trouble hearing the dialogue in
            synchronized media material to be able to view the material and see the dialogue and
            sounds - without requiring people who are not deaf to watch the captions.
            With this technique all of the dialogue and important sounds are embedded as
            text in a fashion that causes the text not to be visible unless the user
            requests it. As a result they are visible only when needed. This requires
            special support for captioning in the user agent.</p>
      <p>NOTE: Captions should not be confused with subtitles. Subtitles provide text
            of only the dialogue and do not include important sounds.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>In order to ensure that users who are deaf can use their
                interactive educational materials, the college provides captions and
                instructions for turning on captions for all of their audio
                interactive educational programs.</p>
         
      </section>
      <section class="example">
         
            <p>The online movies at a media outlet all include
                captions and are provided in a format that allows embedding of
                closed captions.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>Special caption files including synchronization
                information are provided for an existing movie. Players are
                available that can play the captions in a separate window on screen,
                synchronized with the movie window.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>A video of a local news event has captions provided that
                can be played over the video or in a separate window depending on
                the player used.</p>
