      <p>Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble reading text that is single spaced. A button that increases the line height will help them read the content. In order to retain the separation of paragraphs, the space between paragraphs should also increase so that it is at least 1.5 times as high as the line spacing.</p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a
              <a>conforming alternate version</a>
              for non-conforming content. Refer to
