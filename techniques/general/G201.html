			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to provide advanced warning for links that open a new 
            window or tab when activated by the user. This only applies to "regular" activation, such as 
            a left-click on a mouse, or pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> when the link has focus – actions that normally
            would open the link target in the current tab or window; the technique does not apply to situations
            where the user explicitly chooses to open the link in a new tab or window – for instance, using the
            browser's context menu option, or middle-clicking on a mouse.</p>
            <p>Opening a new tab or window when
            a link is activated can be disorienting for people who have difficulty
            perceiving visual content, and for some people with cognitive disabilities,
            if they are not warned in advance. Providing a warning or indication that a link
            will open a new tab or window allows the user
            to decide it they want to leave the current tab or window. It will also help
            them understand that, once they follow the link, their browser's "back" button
            will not work and that they have to return to the last tab or window they
            had open, in order to find their previous location.</p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>This technique is advisory. While indicating that a link "opens in a new window"
              is considered a good practice, is not required to meet the requirements of any
              particular success criterion.</p>

          <h3>Using CSS to provide a warning before opening a new window</h3>

          <p>The code below uses CSS to provide a warning before opening a new
            window.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Link opens in new window notification&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    body {
      background:#fff;
      color: #000;
      font: 1rem/1.5 system-ui, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    }

    [hidden] {
      display:none;
    }

    .new-window-icon {
      fill:currentColor;
      height:0.75rem;
      margin-inline-start:0.3em;
      vertical-align:middle;
      width:0.75rem;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;svg hidden&gt;
    &lt;symbol id="new-window-icon" viewBox="0 0 12 12"&gt;
      &lt;title id="new-win-desc"&gt;opens in a new window&lt;/title&gt;			
      ...
    &lt;/symbol&gt;
  &lt;/svg&gt;

  &lt;h1&gt;Link opens in new window notification&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an example of an 
     &lt;a aria-describedby="new-win-desc" href="https://example.com" rel="noopener" 
     target="_blank"&gt;external link&lt;svg class="new-window-icon" aria-hidden="true"
     role="img"&gt;&lt;use href="#new-window-icon"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
