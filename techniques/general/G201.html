			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to provide advanced warning for links and buttons that open a new 
            window or tab when activated by the user. This only applies to "regular" activation, such as 
            a left-click on a mouse, or pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> when the link or button has
            focus – actions that normally would open the link target in the current tab or window, trigger an action
            on the current page, or result in a form submission and a loading a confirmation page in in the current tab or window.
            The technique does not apply to situations where the user explicitly chooses to open a new tab or window – for instance,
            when using the browser's context menu option, or middle-clicking a link with the mouse.</p>
            <p>Opening a new tab or window when
            a link or button is activated can be disorienting for people who have difficulty
            perceiving visual content, and for some people with cognitive disabilities,
            if they are not warned in advance. Providing a warning or indication that a new tab or window
            will be opened allows the user to decide it they want to leave the current tab or window. It will also help
            them understand that, once they follow they activate the link or button, their browser's "back" button
            will not work and that they have to return to the last tab or window they
            had open, in order to find their previous location.</p>

							<h3>Including the warning in the text describing a control</h3>
							<p>The name or label that describes a control can include the warning
                about opening in a new window.</p>

          <h3>Using an icon and accessible description to provide a warning before opening a new window</h3>

          <p>The code below uses CSS to add an SVG icon to a link, providing a visual warning before opening a new
            window. In addition, <code>aria-describedby</code> is used on the link to include an equivalent text warning
            for assistive technology users.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Link opens in new window notification&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    body {
      background:#fff;
      color: #000;
      font: 1rem/1.5 system-ui, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    }

    [hidden] {
      display:none;
    }

    .new-window-icon {
      fill:currentColor;
      height:0.75rem;
      margin-inline-start:0.3em;
      vertical-align:middle;
      width:0.75rem;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;svg hidden&gt;
    &lt;symbol id="new-window-icon" viewBox="0 0 12 12"&gt;
      &lt;title id="new-win-desc"&gt;opens in a new window&lt;/title&gt;			
      ...
    &lt;/symbol&gt;
  &lt;/svg&gt;

  &lt;h1&gt;Link opens in new window notification&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an example of an 
     &lt;a aria-describedby="new-win-desc" href="https://example.com" rel="noopener" 
     target="_blank"&gt;external link&lt;svg class="new-window-icon" aria-hidden="true"
     role="img"&gt;&lt;use href="#new-window-icon"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
