			<h2>When to Use</h2>
      <p>The Technique is applicable to any technology that supports the display of additional content on pointer hover.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Content that is displayed in a popup when users move the pointer over a trigger or focus the trigger with the keboard needs to stay visible when users move their pointer over the popup content. Low vision users using screen magnification often see only a small part of the screen. This means that the popup content may not be fully visible in the currently visible section. Often, the position of content visible in the enlarged section changes based on users' mouse movement, so magnification users may move their mouse over partly visible popup content to read it. Web content should therefore ensue that popup content stays vsisible when the pointer moves away from the trigger to (mostly adjacent) popup content.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Copy the following section for each example. Examples must have a title and a description, and usually have a code sample. Code samples should be elided if necessary to show the core of the technique without necessarily providing all the surrounding code that would also be involved. A working example link references a location where the technique can be shown working live.</p>

				<h3>Example Title</h3>
				<p>Description</p>
				<code>Code sample</code>

		<section id="tests">
			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Tests must have a test procedure and expected results. Populate the following sections as appropriate. If a technique has multiple alternative testing approaches, add a new section with class="test" for each one, and put the test-procedure and test-results sections inside that.</p>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Step 1</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Result</li>
