   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that the visible label for any interactive component within Web content makes the component's purpose clear. Using the appropriate technology-specific techniques for technologies for associating labels with interactive controls allows assistive technology to recognize the label and present it to the user, therefore allowing the user to identify the purpose of the control. The label may also be used to include text or a text symbol indicating that input is required.

         <h3>Online maps with controls for zooming in and out</h3>
         
            <p>A Web application presents maps of a city. Users can “zoom in" to view part of the map in greater detail, and can “zoom out" to make it show a larger part of the city. The controls can be operated using either a mouse or a keyboard. The controls are labeled “Zoom in (Ctrl + Shift + L)" And “Zoom out (Ctrl + Shift + R)."</p>
