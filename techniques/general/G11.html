      <p>Technologies that support blinking content.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to minimize the distraction caused by blinking content and enable users to re-focus on the other content on the page.</p>
      <p>Blinking content can be created using a variety of technologies, many of which include options to loop blinking content continuously or to otherwise specify the amount of time the blinking content is displayed. Limiting the blinking of content to five seconds minimizes the distraction that blinking can cause. This will benefit people with certain types of learning disabilities and people with low vision.</p>
