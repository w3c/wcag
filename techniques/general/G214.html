            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users to access content in the way the
               user prefers. A content provider may expect that most users will view content using
               a specific device orientation or may expect that a user will want to maintain the
               original view within the device. As a result the provider then prevents the content
               from rotating. By providing a control to allow the user to rotate the content, someone
               who needs to use a particular orientation will be able to view the content in a comfortable
               manner. For example, a person who cannot hold the device and has it mounted attached
               to a wheelchair or bed.

            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>Many users will expect to use OS-level settings to prevent the orientation from changing.
                  As a result, it is usually preferable to satisfy this Success Criterion by not restricting
                  the content's ability to adapt to changes in orientation and allowing users to use
                  the OS orientation lock when desired.

               <h3>Example 1: An e-Reader application</h3>
               <p>Users of an e-Reader web application sometimes read when laying down on their side.
                  In this situation, the device is viewed by the user in portrait mode even though the
                  device is in the landscape orientation with regard to gravity. The developer locks
                  the content into the portrait orientation to allow for this reading behavior, but
                  also provides a control to allow users who have devices mounted in a specific orientation
                  to achieve the desired viewing orientation.
