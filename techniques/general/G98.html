            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>Sites that collect data from users that is specific to the moment it is submitted,
               such as test data, and cannot be changed once it is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/error-prevention-legal-financial-data">Success Criterion 3.3.4: Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)</a> (Sufficient)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide users with a way to ensure their input
               is correct before completing an irreversible transaction. Testing, financial, and
               legal applications permit transactions to occur which cannot be "undone". It is therefore
               important that there be no errors in the data submission, as the user will not have
               the opportunity to correct the error once the transaction has been committed.
            </p>
            <p>On a simple, 1-page form this is easy because the user can review the form before
               submitting. On a form that spans multiple Web pages, however, data is collected from
               the user in multiple steps before the transaction is committed. The user may not recall
               all of the data that was entered in previous steps before the step which commits the
               transaction.
            </p>
            <p>One approach is to cache the results of each individual step and allow the user to
               navigate back and forth at will to review all data entered. Another approach is to
               provide a summary of all data collected in all steps for the user to review prior
               to the final commitment of the transaction.
            </p>
            <p>Before the final step that commits the transaction to occur, instructions are provided
               to prompt the user to review the data entered and confirm. Once the user confirms,
               the transaction is completed.

                     <li>Select "transfer from" account</li>
                     
                     <li>Select "transfer to" account</li>
                     
                     <li>Enter transfer amount</li>

                  <p>A summary of the transaction is provided showing the from and to accounts and the
                     transfer amount. The user can select a button to either complete the transaction or
                     cancel it.

               <li>A testing application provides multiple pages of questions. At any time, the user
                  can choose to return to previously completed sections to review and change answers.
                  A final page is displayed providing buttons to either submit the test answers or review
                  answers.
