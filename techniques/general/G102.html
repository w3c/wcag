            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide information necessary to understand
               an abbreviation.
            </p>
            <p>An abbreviation is the shortened form of a word, phrase, or name. For most abbreviations,
               providing the full word, phrase, or name is sufficient.
            </p>
            <p>Some abbreviations represent words or phrases that are borrowed from a foreign language.
               For instance, many commonly used abbreviations in English are derived from Latin phrases,
               such as the short list of examples given below. The expanded form is only provided
               here as background information. For this category of abbreviations, providing an explanation
               is more helpful than the original expanded form, and the explanation of the abbreviation
               is provided instead of the expansion.

            <p>If abbreviations do not need an expansion (for example, because the original expansion
               has been rejected by the organization that it refers to or if the abbreviation has
               become part of the language), provide an explanation, if appropriate, or treat the
               abbreviation as a word that does not require explanation.

               <h3>Example 5: Phrases that were once abbreviations, but have become part of the language</h3>
               <p>The Dutch fragment "'s nachts" meaning "at night" was originally an abbreviation for
                  "des nachts". In the current Dutch language, the word "des" is rarely used anymore
                  and perceived as archaic. Providing an expansion could be confusing. For "'s nachts"
                  an expansion is not provided.
               </p>
               <p>The English phrase "o'clock" was originally an abbreviation for "of the clock". Since
                  then, "o'clock" has become part of the English language and an expansion does not
                  need to be provided.
