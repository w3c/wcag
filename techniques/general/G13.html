      <p>Applies to all technologies.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide information to users about
            what will happen when a change to a form control results in a change of
            context. Because changing the value of a form control does not typically
            result in a change of context, it is important that authors provide
            instructions that make the user aware of the behavior in advance. Where
            possible, it is a good idea to programmatically associate the instructions
            describing the change with the form control itself.</p>
      <p>The following are some examples of how to provide the instruction in different situations.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Provide instruction on the Web page with reading order that precedes the user interface element that causes change of context by change of setting.</li>
         <li>For a multi-step process where users must complete particular steps in order to reach the user interface element where changes of setting would cause a change of context, provide the instruction as part of the process prior to the step where they would encounter the change of context.</li>
         <li>In the case of an intranet where user training is required prior to the use of a Web application where user interface elements that cause changes of context when settings are changed, instruction is provided as part of the training.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
         <li>A series of radio buttons at the top of a page include
                options for German, French and Spanish. Instructions precede
                the buttons that instruct the user that the language will be
                changed upon selecting an option.</li>
         <li>A 50 question online survey displays one question at a time.
                Instructions appear at the beginning of the survey that
                explain that users will be taken to the next question of the
                survey upon selecting an answer to each question.</li>
      </ul>

         <ul>
            <li>Locate content where changing the setting of a form control
                  results in a change of context</li>
            <li>Check to see that an explanation of what will happen when the
                  control is changed is available prior to the controls activation</li>
         </ul>
