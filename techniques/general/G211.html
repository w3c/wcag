            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>When speech input users interact with a web page, they usually speak a command followed
               by the reference to some visible label (such as text beside an input field or inside
               a button or link). For example, they may say "click search" to activate a button labelled
               Search. When speech recognition software processes speech input and looks for matches,
               it uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/"> accessible name</a> of controls. Where there is a mismatch between the text in the label and the text
               in the accessible name, it can cause issues for the user. The simplest way to enable
               speech input users and meet 2.5.3 Label in Name is to ensure that the accessible name
               matches the visible text label.
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes more than one text string will be positioned in the vicinity of a control
               that could be considered a candidate for its label. For example, a set of inputs that
               each have their own labels may also be preceded by a heading, an instruction or a
               group label (such as an HTML legend/fieldset or an ARIA group or radiogroup). Note
               that the term "group label" means something different than "label", both programmatically
               and in regard to 2.5.3 Label in Name.
            </p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/label-in-name">Understanding 2.5.3 Label in Name document</a> recommends that only the text string adjacent to or in close proximity to an input
               should be treated as the label when assessing a control's label for the purposes of
               meeting 2.5.3 (see the section "Identifying label text for components"). There are
               both practical and technical reasons for restricting the designation of an input's
               label in this way. The technical reasons are discussed in the Understanding document's
               section called Accessible Name and Description Computation specification.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>Mapping a visible label to the accessible name is achieved in many technologies by
               meeting <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html"> 1.3.1 Information and Relationships</a> through the proper use of native semantics. Many controls derive accessible names
               by correct nesting of elements, while other elements have specific attributes which
               are a valid means of providing or referencing an accessible name.
            </p>
            <p>The accessible name should be assigned through native elements and semantics where
               possible. That helps ensure an exact match between the visible label and name.

               <p>Radio buttons typically appear in a group, where each button is labelled and the group
                  of buttons is preceded by information which explains or categorizes the group.

               </figure>
               <p>The label for each component should be restricted to "Yes" and "No". To meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships"> 1.3.1 Information and Relationships</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html"> 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions</a>, the "Call me…" text can be coded to convey the relationship to ATs, in this example
                  by using a <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code>.
               </p>
               <p>If the label is not restricted to the string adjacent to the radio button, multiple
                  interpretations of what constitutes the label can result in less uniform functionality.
                  If "Yes" alone is not the label for the first radio button, is it "Call me when balance
                  exceeds $10,000"? Or is it a combination of text strings, in which case is the order
                  "Call me when balance exceeds $10,000 Yes" or "Yes, Call me when balance exceeds $10,000"?
                  Decisions to combine text strings can have negative effects on screen reader users
                  since the order of concatenation can affect meaning. In this example, "No, call me
                  when balance exceeds $10,000" could be very confusing to a screen reader user.

               <h3>Example 5: Checkbox Groupings</h3>
               <p>For checkbox groupings, implementations that attempt to incorporate more than just
                  the immediate checkbox label into the accessible name can also be problematic if not
                  isolated to the adjacent text string.
               </p>

                  <figcaption>Figure 2Figure 2 What do you value in our service? checkbox group, with 4 choices.</figcaption>
                  				
               </figure>
               <p>In Figure 2, there is a long text string that combines a group label and instruction,
                  "What do you value in our service (check all that apply)?" Each of the checkboxes
                  also has its own one- or two-word label. In regard to 2.5.3, the labels for the components
                  should be restricted to "Courtesy", "Promptness", "Store Hours" and "Knowledge".
               </p>
               <p>Attempting to include the preceding text as part of the accessible name can potentially
                  make it more difficult to isolate a control by spoken commands for speech-input users.
                  Such a construction will also negatively increase verbosity for screen reader users
                  (with the combined text strings read out for each of the inputs before the input's
                  state). The simplest solution is to restrict the accessible name to the text immediately
                  beside the checkboxes, using similar techniques to those for the standard radio button
                  group.

               <h3>Example 6: Stacked Labels</h3>
               <p>Although labels for comboboxes, dropdown lists, text inputs, and other widgets are
                  typically oriented immediately to the left of the component, there is an alternative
                  established convention where labels are stacked above the inputs, aligned with their
                  left edge.

               <p>In Figure 3, the inputs are stacked and left-aligned, with the labels immediately
                  preceding each input, also left-aligned. There is additional white space between the
                  label and the preceding input so that the label is closest to its associated text
                  input. Stacked labels are relatively common in mobile designs, where horizontal space
                  is constrained.
               </p>
               <p>Figure 4 shows a variation on stacked labels, where hints and guidance are included
                  between the label and the input. This design does not provide an adjacent label. However,
                  the "New Password" label is still considered to be in close enough proximity, especially
                  given its size and boldness relative to the smaller and lower-contrast guidance text.
                  The associations are reinforced programmatically, where the hint text is given a role
                  of <code>aria-describedby</code> and the label is properly associated with the input.

               <p>The hint text in such implementations should be kept to a single line where possible,
                  since accessibility issues can arise where a more lengthy hint separates the label
                  from its input. Figure 4 illustrates that the concept of "adjacent text" is a guide
                  for label interpretation, but cannot always serve as a hard rule.
