         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.2 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique,
            and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology
            can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.2.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting
               the information in a video-only presentation.
            </p>
            <p>In a video-only presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including
               animation, text or graphics, the setting and background, the actions and expressions
               of people, animals, etc. In order to present the same information in accessible form,
               this technique involves creating a document that tells the same story and presents
               the same information as the prerecorded video-only content. In this technique, the
               document serves as a long description for the content and includes all of the important
               information as well as descriptions of scenery, actions, expressions, etc. that are
               part of the presentation.
            </p>
            <p>If a screenplay for the video-only content was used to create the content in the first
               place, this can be a good place to start. In production and editing however, the final
               version often varies somewhat from the screenplay. To use the screenplay, it would
               need to be corrected to match the final edited form of the video-only presentation.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>An animation shows how to assemble a woodworking project. There is no audio, but the
                  animation includes a series of numbers to represent each step in the process as well
                  as arrows and picture-in-picture highlights illustrating how the assembly is completed.
                  It also includes short outtake animations illustrating what will happen if assembly
                  is done incorrectly. A text alternative that identifies the video-only content reads,
                  "Breadbox assembly video (text description follows)," and the text description of
                  the video includes a full text description of each step in the video.
