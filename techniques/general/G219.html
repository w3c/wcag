         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this Technique is to ensure that people with motor impairments who
               cannot carry out <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#" target="terms">dragging movements</a> are presented with a single pointer operable alternative. Some direct manipulation
               interfaces allow users to pick up targets and move them to another position, for example,
               to change the position of an item in a priority list in a list, or to change the status
               of a task in a Kanban implementation (a type of visual process management view which
               shows tasks in vertical lanes representing process steps such as ‘scheduled’, ‘processed’,
               ‘completed’).
            </p>
            <p>The single pointer operable alternative may require the user to carry out a series
               of single pointer interactions (for example, activating a target to be moved; opening
               a dropdown menu; and selecting a drop destination from the list of menu items offered).

               <h3>Example 1</h3>
               <ul>
                  				
                  <li>A list of items can be re-ordered by picking up an item and dragging it upwards or
                     downwards. Other elements move dynamically to open a gap where the picked-up target
                     can be dropped. After a single pointer activation, the list items display up and down
                     arrows which allow a step-wise re-ordering of the the list via a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#" target="terms">single pointer</a> inputs (taps or clicks at the up or down arrow).
                  </li>
                  				
                  <li>A vertical priority list indicates the priority of items listed. Each item can be
                     ‘picked up’ with a pointer and dragged up or down to another position. The other list
                     items rearrange dynamically. To the left of each list item, a number in a text field
                     shows the current priority position. For any of the items, users can put in another
                     number. This leads to a dynamic reordering and renumbering of the priority list.
                  </li>
                  				
                  <li>In a Kanban implementation for process management, tasks can be dragged horizontally
                     from one ‘swimming lane’ to another in order to change the status of tasks (for example,
                     to change the status of a task from “in process” to “completed”). One or several items
                     in a lande can be selected by a single tap or click. A single pointer activation of
                     a drop-down menu labelled “Move selected items to” offers a selection of drop targets
                     (other lanes). A further single pointer activation over the desired menu item moves
                     targets to the specified lane.
                  </li>
                  				
                  <li>In a Kanban implementation for process management, tasks can be dragged horizontally
                     from one ‘swimming lane’ to another in order to change the status of tasks. A directional
                     horizontal swipe over an item moves it to the adjacent lane. This process can be repeated
                     until the item is in the desired lane.

                     other way, only that this technique has not been successfully implemented and cannot
                     be used to claim conformance.
