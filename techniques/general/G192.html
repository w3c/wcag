      <p>This technique relates to all markup languages with specifications.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>When markup languages are used in a way that fully conforms to their specifications, all of the requirements in 4.1.1 are met. Therefore, while fully conforming to specifications is not required to conform to WCAG 2.0, it is a best practice and is sufficient to meet Success Criterion 4.1.1.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>A page is created with care to make sure that all technologies are used according to specification. It is run through a validator and all identified errors are corrected. Specification requirements that can not be identified by validation are also checked and any failures are corrected.</li>
      </ul>
