			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to provide information that was previously provided by the user or by the system, rather than requiring the user to remember and re-enter the information from a previous step. This improves success for individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities and memory impairments.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Populate previously entered information with a trigger</h3>
				<p>An ecommerce site provides a checkbox that triggers the shipping address to be pre-populated based on the billing address the user had entered in a previous step. </p>

			<section class="example">
				<h3>Automatically populate information based on previous answers</h3>
				<p>During a two-step process for setting up a business, the first step provides a business identification number after the user enters a name, and address. The second step requires creating a user profile. The business identification number, name and address are prepopulated. </p>
