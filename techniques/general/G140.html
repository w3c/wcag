            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to facilitate the interaction of assistive technology
               with content by logically separating the content's structural encoding from the presentational
               encoding. Structural encoding is the indication of elements such as headings, paragraphs,
               lists, tables, etc., and is done by using technology features reserved for the purpose.
               By contrast, presentational encoding is the indication of formatting effects, such
               as typeface, color, size, position, borders, etc., and is also supported by technology
               features.
            </p>
            <p>While presentational features visually imply structure — users can determine headings,
               paragraphs, lists, etc. from the formatting conventions used — these features do not
               encode the structure unambiguously enough for assistive technology to interact with
               the page effectively. Providing separate structure, functionality, and presentation
               layers allows the semantics implied by the formatting to become programmatically determined
               via the structure layer.
            </p>
            <p>Following this technique allows user agents to:</p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Perform meaningful structure transformations based on the existing structure of the
                  content, such as reordering sections or generating a list of sections or a list of
                  links.
               </li>
               
               <li>Support interaction with content based on structural characteristics that cannot be
                  determined by assistive technology on the basis of presentational information alone.
                  For instance, it may be desirable to provide special interactions with lists by indicating
                  the number of list items or skipping to the end, but this is only possible if the
                  list structure is encoded in addition to the list presentation.
               </li>
               
               <li>Modify the presentation of content by substituting alternate presentation rules attached
                  to structural features.
               </li>
               
            </ul>

               <h3>Example 1: HTML with CSS</h3>
               <p>An HTML document uses the structural features of HTML, such as paragraphs, lists,
                  headings, etc., and avoids presentational features such as font changes, layout hints,
                  etc. CSS is used to format the document based on its structural properties. Well-crafted
                  "class" attributes in the HTML extend the semantics of the structural markup if needed
                  to allow more flexible formatting with CSS. Assistive technologies can substitute
                  or extend the CSS to modify presentation, or ignore the CSS and interact directly
                  with the structural encoding.

               <h3>Example 2: Tagged PDF</h3>
               <p>A PDF document consists mostly of the content embedded with formatting information.
                  Information about the structure is provided in a separate section of the document
                  using XML-like tags; this is called "tagged PDF". The information in these tags can
                  be used by assistive technologies to perform meaningful structure transformations
                  (e.g., generating a list of sections) or to support interaction with content based
                  on structural characteristics (e.g., jumping to the start of forms).
