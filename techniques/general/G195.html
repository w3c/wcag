   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is enhance the focus indicator in the browser, by creating a  visible one in the content. The default focus indicator in some browsers is a thin, dotted, black line. It can be difficult to see the line when it is around a form element which already has an outline, when the focused element is inside a table cell, when the focused element is very small, or when the background of the page is a dark color. Some browsers use a pale blue outline, which can be difficult to see on some backgrounds.</p>
      <p>In this technique, when the user places focus on an element using the keyboard, the application makes that focus more visible, using a combination of a highly contrasting color, a thick line, and other visual indicators such as a glow.</p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <section class="example">
         <h3>Links</h3>
            <p>A Web page has a dark background color and light text and links. When focus lands on a link, the link is outlined with a bright yellow line, 3 pixels wide.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="example">
         <h3>Form Elements</h3>
         
            <p>A Web page includes a form inside a table. The borders of both the table and the form elements are thin, black lines. When focus lands on a form element, the element is outlined with a 5 pixel red line that is partially transparent. The red is equivalent to a hex color of #FF3838, providing a 3.6:1 contrast ratio with the white background.</p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Menus</h3>
         
            <p>A Web page includes an interactive menu with sub-menus. A user can move focus in the menu using the arrow keys. As focus moves, the currently focused menu item changes its background to a different color, which has a 3:1 contrast ratio with the surrounding items and a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its own text.</p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>For each user interface component on the page that should receive keyboard focus:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the element and check that it has a visible focus indicator.</li>
            <li>Check that the focus indicator area is at least the size of a 1 CSS px border around the component.</li>
            <li>If the focus indicator area is not at least equal to the area of a 1 CSS pixel border, check that it has an area of at least 4 CSS pixels along the shortest side of the element.</li>
            <li>Check that the change of contrast of the indicator between focused and unfocused states has a ratio of 3:1 or more for the minimum focus indicator area.</li>
            <li>If the focus indicator does not have 3:1 contrast ratio with its adjacent colors, check that it is at least 2px thick.</li>
         </ol>
