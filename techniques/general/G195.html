      <p>The objective of this technique is enhance the focus indicator in the browser, by creating a highly visible one in the content. The default focus indicator in many browsers is a thin, dotted, black line. It can be difficult to see the line when it is around a form element which already has an outline, when the focused element is inside a table cell, when the focused element is very small, or when the background of the page is a dark color. Some browsers use a pale blue outline, which can be difficult to see on some backgrounds.</p>
      <p>In this technique, when the user places focus on an element, using the mouse, tab key, arrow keys, keyboard shortcuts, or any other method, the application makes that focus more visible, using a combination of a highly contrasting color, a thick line, and other visual indicators such as a glow.</p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Links</h3>
        
            <p>A Web page has a dark background color and light text and links. When focus lands on a link, the link is outlined with a bright yellow line, 3 pixels wide.</p>
             <figure id="dark-background-light-link">
                <img src="img/dark-background-light-link.png" alt="Two light blue links on a dark gray background. The focused link has a bright yellow border." />
                <figcaption> The bright yellow 3px thick indicator for a light link on a dark background creates a highly visisble focus indicator</figcaption>
            </figure>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Form Elements</h3>
         
            <p>A Web page includes a form inside a table. The borders of both the table and the form elements are thin, black lines. When focus lands on a form element, the element is outlined with a 5 pixel red line that is partially transparent. The red is equivelent to a hex color of #FF3838, providing a 3.6:1 contrast ratio with the white background.</p>
            <figure id="form-in-table-focus-border">
                <img src="img/form-in-table-focus-border.png" alt="Two forms inside tables with thin borders. The focused form element has a partially transparent red outline." />
                <figcaption> The 5 px thick partially transparent red outline on the form element creates a highly visisble focus indicator</figcaption>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Menus</h3>
         
            <p>A Web page includes an interactive menu with sub-menus. A user can move focus in the menu using the arrow keys. As focus moves, the currently focused menu item changes its background to a different color, which has a 3:1 contrast ratio with the surrouding items and a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its own text.</p>
            <figure id="fmenu-submenu-background-focus">
                <img src="img/menu-submenu-background-focus.png" alt="Two menus with sub-menu items. The focused form menu item changes background color that to purple and text color to white." />
                <figcaption> The contrast ratio of the focused menu item background being at least 3:1 relative to surrounding elements, and 4.5:1 relative to its text creates a highly visisble focus indicator</figcaption>

         <ol>
            <li>Place focus on each focusable user interface element on the page using the mouse.</li>
            <li>Check that there is a highly visible focus indicator.</li>
            <li>Place focus on each focusable user interface element on the page using the keyboard.</li>
            <li>Check that the focus indicator area is at least the size of a 1 CSS px border around the component.</li>
            <li>Check that the change of contrast of the indicator between focused and unfocused states has a ratio of 3:1 for the minimum focus indicator area.</li>
            <li>If the focus indicator does not have 3:1 contrast ratio with its adjacent colors, check that it is at least 2px thick.</li>
