            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is enhance the focus indicator in the browser, by
               creating a highly visible one in the content. The default focus indicator in many
               browsers is a thin, dotted, black line. It can be difficult to see the line when it
               is around a form element which already has an outline, when the focused element is
               inside a table cell, when the focused element is very small, or when the background
               of the page is a dark color. Some browsers use a pale blue outline, which can be difficult
               to see on some backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>In this technique, when the user places focus on an element, using the mouse, tab
               key, arrow keys, keyboard shortcuts, or any other method, the application makes that
               focus more visible, using a combination of a highly contrasting color, a thick line,
               and other visual indicators such as a glow.

               <h3>Example 1: Links</h3>
               <p>A Web page has a dark background color and light text and links. When focus lands
                  on a link, the link is outlined with a bright yellow line, 3 pixels wide.

               <h3>Example 2: Form Elements</h3>
               <p>A Web page includes a form inside a table. The borders of both the table and the form
                  elements are thin, black lines. When focus lands on a form element, the element is
                  outlined with a 5 pixel red line that is partially transparent.

               <h3>Example 3: Menus</h3>
               <p>A Web page includes an interactive menu with sub-menus. A user can move focus in the
                  menu using the arrow keys. As focus moves, the currently focused menu item changes
                  its background to a different color, which has a 3:1 contrast ratio with the surrouding
                  items and a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its own text.
