         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <p>Web pages that require user authentication and limit the time available for submitting
               data.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Web servers that require user authentication often terminate the session after a set
               period of time if there is no activity from the user. If the user is unable to input
               the data quickly enough and the session times out before they submit, the server will
               require re-authentication before proceeding. When this happens, the server stores
               the data in a temporary cache while the user logs in, and when the user has re-authenticated,
               the data is made available from the cache and the form is processed as if there had
               never been a session time-out. The server does not keep the cache indefinitely, merely
               long enough to ensure success after re-authentication in a single user session, such
               as one day.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A user logs in to use a forum and replies to a post. The time taken to write the reply
                  is longer than the time allowed by the server for a session of inactivity. The user
                  submits the reply and is informed of the time out and prompted to log in again to
                  submit the response. The user's post reply is retained by the server and if the user
                  log-in is successful the reply  is processed as normal. If the log-in cannot be successfully
                  completed the reply is discarded.
               </li>
               
               <li>A user logs in to a secure area and fills out a form. The session times out for security
                  reasons. The form data is retained by the server and the user is informed of the time
                  out and is prompted to log-in again. If the user logs in correctly, the form is presented
                  to the user with all of the data previously entered and user can submit the form.
                  If the log-in cannot be successfully completed the form data is discarded.
