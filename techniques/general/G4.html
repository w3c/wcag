      <p>Any technology that includes moving or scrolling content.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a way to pause movement or scrolling of content. If the user needs to pause the movement, to reduce distraction or to have time to read it, they can do so, and then restart it as needed. This mechanism can be provided either through interactive controls that conform to WCAG or through keyboard shortcuts. If keyboard shortcuts are used, they are documented.</p>
   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>A site contains a scrolling news banner at the top of the page. Users who need more time to read it can press the Escape key to pause the scrolling. Pressing Escape again restarts it.</li>
         <li>A Web page contains a link labeled "How to tie a shoe" which links to an animation. Text  immediately preceding the link informs the user that pressing the spacebar will pause the animation and restart it again.</li>
      </ul>
