		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The objective of this technique is to mark up the structure of the Web content using the appropriate semantic elements. In other words, the elements are used according to their meaning, not because of the way they appear visually.</p>
		<p>Using the appropriate semantic elements will make sure the structure is available to the user agent. This involves explicitly indicating the role that different units have in understanding the meaning of the content. The nature of a piece of content as a paragraph, header, emphasized text, table, etc. can all be indicated in this way. In some cases, the relationships between units of content should also be indicated, such as between headings and subheadings, or amongst the cells of a table. The user agent can then make the structure perceivable to the user, for example using a different visual presentation for different types of structures or by using a different voice or pitch in an auditory presentation.</p>
		<p>In HTML, for example, phrase-level elements such as <code class="language-html">em</code>, <code class="language-html">abbr</code>, and <code class="language-html">cite</code> add semantic information within sentences, marking text for emphasis and identifying abbreviations and citations, respectively. MathML, a markup language designed to maintain important distinctions between structure and presentation in mathematics, includes special "presentation" markup for the complex notations used to represent mathematical ideas as well as "content" (semantic) markup for the mathematical ideas themselves.</p>

		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<section class="example">
			<h3>Linking to another page</h3>
			<p>A paragraph contains a hyperlink to another page. The hyperlink is marked up using the <code class="language-html">a</code> element.</p>   
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;Do you want to try our new tool yourself? A free demonstration
  version is available in our &lt;a href="download.html"&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

      <section class="example">
				<h3>Using <code class="language-html">cite</code> and <code class="language-html">blockquote</code> to reference a book and a quotation from it</h3>
				<p>A page about the history of marriage uses a quotation from Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice, as an example. The reference to the book is marked up using the <code class="language-html">cite</code> element and the quotation itself is marked up using the <code class="language-html">blockquote</code> element.</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;Marriage was considered a logical step for a bachelor, as can be seen in the
   first chapter of the novel &lt;cite&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/cite&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in
   possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However little known the feelings or views of such a man may
   be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well
   fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered
   the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code></pre>

				<h3>Using the <code class="language-html">strong</code> element to emphasize important text</h3>
				<p>A car manual explains how to start the engine. The instructions include a warning to make sure the gear is in neutral. The author feels the warning is so important that it should be emphasized so the warning is marked up using the <code class="language-html">strong</code> element.</p> 
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-html">&lt;h1&gt;How to start the engine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting the engine, &lt;strong&gt;make sure the gear is in neutral&lt;/strong&gt;
   Next, turn the key in the ignition. The engine should start.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
