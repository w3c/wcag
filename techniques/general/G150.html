         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.2 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique,
            and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology
            can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.2.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear to be able to access
               real-time audio broadcasts. It is more difficult to create accurate real-time alternatives
               because there is little time to correct mistakes, to listen a second time or to consult
               someone to be sure the words are accurately reproduced. It is also harder to simplify
               or paraphrase information if it is flowing too quickly.
            </p>
            <p>Real-time typing text entry techniques exist using stenographic and rapid typing technologies.
               Re-voicing speech-to-text (where a person listens to speech and then carefully re-voices
               it into a computer trained to their speech) is used today for telephone relay services
               and may be used in the future for captioning. Eventually speech-to-text with correction
               will be possible.

            <ul>
               
               <li>A radio station uses Web based captioning services to provide alternatives for live
                  sporting events; the output from the service is incorporated in a viewport of the
                  Web page which also includes a streaming audio control.
