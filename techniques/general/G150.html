      <p>All technologies that present live audio-only information</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear to be able to access real-time audio broadcasts. It is more difficult to create accurate real-time alternatives because there is little time to correct mistakes, to listen a second time or to consult someone to be sure the words are accurately reproduced. It is also harder to simplify or paraphrase information if it is flowing too quickly.</p>
      <p>Real-time typing text entry techniques exist using stenographic and rapid typing technologies. Re-voicing speech-to-text (where a person listens to speech and then carefully re-voices it into a computer trained to their speech) is used today for telephone relay services and may be used in the future for captioning. Eventually speech-to-text with correction will be possible.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>A radio station uses Web based captioning services to provide alternatives for live sporting events; the output from the service is incorporated in a viewport of the Web page which also includes a streaming audio control.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Check that a procedure and policy is in place to ensure that text alternatives are delivered in real-time.</li>
            <li>Check that procedure and policy are working by conducting a random sample to see if text alternatives appear.</li>
         </ol>
