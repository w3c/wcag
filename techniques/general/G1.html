            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/bypass-blocks">Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass Blocks</a> (Sufficient as a way to meet an unwritten technique)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism to bypass blocks of material
               that are repeated on multiple Web pages by skipping directly to the main content of
               the Web page. The first interactive item in the Web page is a link to the beginning
               of the main content. Activating the link sets focus beyond the other content to the
               main content. This technique is most useful when a Web page has one main content area,
               rather than a set of content areas that are equally important, and when there are
               not multiple navigation sections on the page.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>It is preferable for links to be visible at all times, since users navigating via
                     the keyboard include switch users, those using techniques that generate keyboard strokes
                     slowly, screen magnification software users, screen reader users working with sighted
                     colleagues, keyboard only users and those navigating using voice recognition software.
                     However, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks">Success Criterion 2.4.1</a> does not require that they be visible when they do not have focus, and links that
                     are visible only when they have focus can meet this success criterion.

               <h3>Example 1: An online newspaper</h3>
               <p>An on-line newspaper contains many sections of information: a search function, a corporate
                  banner, sidebars, minor stories, how to contact the newspaper, etc. The lead story
                  is located in the middle of the page. The first link that the user reaches when tabbing
                  through the page is titled "Skip to Lead Story". Activating the link moves visual
                  focus to the story. Pressing tab again takes the user to the first link in the main
                  story.

               <h3>Example 2: A "Skip to main content" link</h3>
               <p>A Web page includes a variety of navigation techniques on each page: a bread crumb
                  trail, a search tool, a site map, and a list of related resources. The first link
                  on the page is titled "Skip to Main Content". A user activates the link to skip over
                  the navigation tools.
