      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide the definition of words, phrases, jargon, or abbreviation expansions by adding a mechanism to access an on-line dictionary to the Web page. This technique uses existing resources on the Web to provide the definition rather than requiring the author to create a glossary or other mechanism within the site. By providing access from within the Web page, a user can easily locate the desired definition. This technique can only be used if the online dictionary returns the correct definition.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>A site that describes how a computer works would include a search feature on each Web page. The search would be performed against an on-line dictionary of computer terms, acronyms, and abbreviations. Since the dictionary is specialized for computer terms, the acronym expansion found should be more accurate than with a general dictionary.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>An online course in English grammar provides a paragraph of text which introduces new vocabulary words. Each of the vocabulary words is a link to an on-line dictionary to find the definition of the word. Activating a link will open up a new window to an online dictionary site with the specific vocabulary word defined.</p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>For each word, phrase, or abbreviation to be defined:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Check that a mechanism exists within the Web page to search for the word, phrase, or abbreviation via an on-line dictionary.</li>
            <li>Check that the result of the search of the dictionary for the word, phrase, or abbreviation is the correct definition.</li>
         </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Checks #1 and #2 are true.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Note: The definition of abbreviation used in WCAG is: "shortened form of a word, phrase, or name where the original expansion has not been rejected by the organization that it refers to and where the abbreviation has not become part of the language."</p>
