            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>Colored text when color alone is used to convey information such as words that are
               links in a paragraph
            </p>

         <section id="description">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The intent of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may
               not be able to discern a difference in text color. Color is commonly used to indicate
               words that are links within a paragraph or other block of text. For example, scattered
               words in text may be hypertext links that are identified only by a difference in color
               with surrounding text. This technique describes a way to provide additional cues on
               hover and focus so that users who may have difficulty perceiving color differences
               or have low vision can identify them.
            </p>
            <p>With this technique, a
               <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#" target="terms">relative luminance</a>
               (lightness) difference of 3:1 or greater with the text around it can be used if additional
               visual confirmation is available when a user points or tabs to the link. Visual highlights
               may, for example, take the form of underline, a change in font style such as bold
               or italics, or an increase in font size.
            </p>
            <p>While using this technique is sufficient to meet this success criteria, it is not
               the preferred technique to differentiate link text. This is because links that use
               the relative luminance of color alone may not be obvious to people with black/white
               color blindness. If there are not a large number of links in the block of text, underlines
               are recommended for links.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>This technique is about the use of color in addition to luminosity. In this technique,
                     the contrast ratio refers to the contrast between a link and the words around it.
                     In Success Criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast ratio refers to the contrast between
                     a word and its background. The difference is that  this technique is about the ability
                     for users to tell the difference (a noticeable difference) between different pieces
                     of text whereas the contrast ratio used in success criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 is about
                     the readability of the text with its background for different color and vision disabilities.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>If an author wants to use the color portion of this technique (i.e., using different
                     colors for the words where the colors have sufficient contrast with each other) and
                     the author also wants to conform to SC 1.4.3 (contrast of both words with their backgrounds)
                     the following colors can be used. (e.g., black text in a paragraph on a white background
                     with the links shown as one of the colors in example 1 below.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>If assistive technology or Web browsers at some point all provide an option to underline
                     all links on Web pages for users, this could be used instead of an author-provided
                     link highlighting mechanism.
