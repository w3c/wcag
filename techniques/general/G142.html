      <p>All technologies with user agent provided zoom capability.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure content can be scaled uniformly by using a Web technology supported by user agents that change text size via a Zoom tool.</p>
      <p>Content authored in technologies that are supported by user agents that can scale content uniformly (that is, zoom into content) satisfy this Success Criterion. Because this technique relies completely on user agent functionality, it is critical to test with a wide variety of user agents.</p>
      <p>This technique requires that the zoom function preserve all spatial relationships on the page and that all functionality continues to be available.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Most modern browsers provide a zoom function that scales HTML/CSS page content uniformly.</li>
         <li>To allow users to resize text, Adobe Reader provides a magnification tool that scales PDF pages uniformly.</li>
      </ul>
