      <p>Applies to all technologies where content includes functionality.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to permit individuals who rely on a keyboard or keyboard interface to access the functionality of the content. To do this, make sure that all event handlers triggered by non-keyboard UI events are also associated with a keyboard-based event, or provide redundant keyboard-based mechanisms to accomplish the functionality provided by other device-specific functions.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>
                <strong>Example 1: A drag and drop feature</strong>
                A photo application includes a "drag" and "drop" feature to allow users to re-order photographs in an on-line album for presentation as a slide show. It also includes a feature that allows users to select a photo and 'cut' and 'paste' the items into the list at the appropriate point using only the keyboard.</li>
         <li>
                <strong>Example 2: A reorder feature</strong>
                A Web application that allows users to create surveys by dragging questions into position includes a list of the questions followed by a text field that allows users to re-order questions as needed by entering the desired question number.</li>
