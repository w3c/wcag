      <p>The objective of this technique is to recognize a paragraph in a plain text document. A paragraph is a coherent block of text, such as a group of related sentences that develop a single topic or a coherent part of a larger topic. </p>
      <p>The beginning of a paragraph is indicated by
</p>
      <ul>
         <li>the beginning of the content, that is, the paragraph is the first content in the document, or</li>
         <li>exactly one blank line preceding the paragraph text</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The end of a paragraph is indicated by 
</p>
      <ul>
         <li>the end of the content, that is, the paragraph is the last content in the document, or</li>
         <li>one or more blank lines following the paragraph text</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A blank line contains zero or more non-printing characters, such as space or tab, followed by a new line.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>Two paragraphs. Each starts and ends with a blank line.</p>
         
         <pre xml:space="preserve">
						
This is the first sentence in this
paragraph. Paragraphs may be long
or short.
   
    In this paragraph the first line is
indented. Indented and non-indented
sentences are allowed. White space within
the paragraph lines is ignored in
defining paragraphs. Only completely blank
lines are significant.
