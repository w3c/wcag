   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this failure condition is to describe a problem that occurs when changing the size of text causes text to be clipped, truncated, or obscured, so that it is no longer available to the user. In general, this failure occurs when there is no way for a user agent's layout engine to honor all the layout hints in the HTML at the new font size. Some of the ways in which this can occur include:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Setting the overflow property of the enclosing element to hidden
							     </li>
         <li>Using absolutely positioned content</li>
         <li>Creating popups that aren't big enough for their content at the new font size</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="note">
         <p>The Working Group has discovered many misunderstandings about how to test this failure. We are planning to revise this failure in a future update. Until then, if the content passes the success criterion using any of the listed sufficient techniques, then it does not meet this failure.</p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Overflowing text</h3>
         
            <p>The font size is set in a scalable way, but the container is set to a fixed pixel size. A gray border shows the boundaries of the text container. When the text is resized, it spills out of its container, and obscures the next paragraph.</p>
         
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-html">&lt;div style="font-size:100%; width:120px; height:100px; border: thin solid gray;"&gt; 
  Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
         
            <p>Illustration of example 1:</p>
            <figure id="figure-text-out-of-container">
            	<img alt="The 'now is the time' text extends out of the bottom of its container, and obscures the start of the 'quick brown fox' text that is outside of the container." src="img/F69-obscured.png" height="129" width="335"/>
            	<figcaption>Example showing text that spills outside of its container, obscuring other text on the page.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
         
      </section>
      <section class="example">
         <h3>Truncated text</h3>
         
            <p>This example is identical to the last one, except that the container is set to clip the text. The text is no longer bleeding into the next paragraph, but now it is truncated. This is also a failure.</p>
         
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-html">&lt;div style="font-size:100%; width:120px; height:100px; overflow: hidden; 
 border: thin solid gray;"&gt;
 Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.

            	<img alt="The 'now is the time' text is clipped so that content after the word 'their' is hidden." src="img/F69-truncated.png" height="129" width="335"/>
