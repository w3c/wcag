			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p>All technologies that include interactive controls that can be triggered using a pointer.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this Failure is to describe situations where:</p>
				<ol> 
					<li>Controls are set to activate functionality on the down-event of a pointer;</li>
					<li>No further mechanism to abort or undo is available;</li>
					<li>The up-event does not reverse the outcome of the activation;</li>
					<li>It is not essential for the functionality to execute and complete on the down-event.</li>
				</ol>
			<p>Rather than taking advantage of the <code class="language-javascript">click</code> event, authors may use down-events such as <code class="language-javascript">mousedown</code>, <code class="language-javascript">touchstart</code> or <code class="language-javascript">pointerdown</code>. As a result, functionality will be executed as soon as a mouse button is pressed (but not released yet), or a finger or stylus makes contact with a touchscreen.</p>
			<p>It is possible to use the down event and mitigate potential issues to avoid failing the Success Criterion. For example, provide a method to easily undo or abort the functionality, or reverse the outcome on the up-event (when the mouse button is released, or when the finger or stylus are lifted from the touchscreen). And note that some uses of the down-event are essential for the functionality (e.g., where the control simulates the operation of a musical instrument like a set of piano keys, or when the control is used as an on-screen control for a game where a fast and immediate response is required), in which case they would not fail this Success Criterion.</p>
			<p class="note">The test procedure outlined below could be supplemented with automated or semi-automated tests to scan for JavaScript that registers event listeners such as <code class="language-javascript">mousedown</code>, <code class="language-javascript">touchstart</code>, or <code class="language-javascript">pointerdown</code>. The automated test would not be sufficient to make a pass/fail determination, but it can help narrow down the number of potentially problematic controls.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
      
      		<section class="example">
				<h3>A close button that triggers on down-events</h3>
				<p>A modal dialog contains a lengthy form that a user needs to complete. The modal provides a simple "Close" control that closes the dialog and loses all information the user may already have entered in the form. However, instead of simply listening to the <code class="language-javascript">click</code> event - which in most user agents is triggered on the up-event - the author decided to close the dialog on the down-event. This may lead to the user accidentally closing the dialog and losing all the data they entered into the form up to that point.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- modal dialog with a form --&gt;
...
&lt;button id="close" type="button"&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;
...</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const trigger = document.getElementById("close");

function closeDialog() {
  /* close the modal dialog */
  ...
}

trigger.addEventListener('mousedown', closeDialog);
trigger.addEventListener('touchstart', closeDialog);
trigger.addEventListener('pointerdown', closeDialog);</code></pre>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<p>Open the content on a device with pointer inputs (mouse, touchscreen, stylus) and for all available controls (buttons, links, complex widgets):</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Trigger down-events (e.g. by pressing but not releasing the mouse button, or placing a finger or stylus on the touchscreen) and check if functionality is executed prior to the up-event (e.g. releasing the mouse button or lifting the finger/stylus)</li>
                    <li>If functionality was executed on the down-event, check if triggering the up-event (releasing the pressed mouse button, or lifting the finger or stylus from the touchscreen) reverses the outcome</li>
                    <li>Evaluate if it could be deemed essential for the controls to execute and complete functionality on the down-event</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If #1 is true, and #2 and #3 are false then the content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
