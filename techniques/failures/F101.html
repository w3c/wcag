            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this Failure is to describe situations where:</p>
            <ol> 
               					
               <li>Controls are set to activate functionality on the down-event of a pointer;</li>
               					
               <li>No further mechanism to abort or undo is available;</li>
               					
               <li>The up-event does not reverse the outcome of the activation;</li>
               					
               <li>It is not essential for the functionality to execute and complete on the down-event.</li>
               				
            </ol>
            <p>Rather than taking advantage of the <code>click</code> event, authors may use down-events such as <code>mousedown</code>, <code>touchstart</code> or <code>pointerdown</code>. As a result, functionality will be executed as soon as a mouse button is pressed
               (but not released yet), or a finger or stylus makes contact with a touchscreen.
            </p>
            <p>It is possible to use the down event and mitigate potential issues to avoid failing
               the Success Criterion. For example, provide a method to easily undo or abort the functionality,
               or reverse the outcome on the up-event (when the mouse button is released, or when
               the finger or stylus are lifted from the touchscreen). And note that some uses of
               the down-event are essential for the functionality (e.g., where the control simulates
               the operation of a musical instrument like a set of piano keys, or when the control
               is used as an on-screen control for a game where a fast and immediate response is
               required), in which case they would not fail this Success Criterion.

               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>The test procedure outlined below could be supplemented with automated or semi-automated
                  tests to scan for JavaScript that registers event listeners such as <code>mousedown</code>, <code>touchstart</code>, or <code>pointerdown</code>. The automated test would not be sufficient to make a pass/fail determination, but
                  it can help narrow down the number of potentially problematic controls.

               <h3>Example 1: A close button that triggers on down-events</h3>
               <p>A modal dialog contains a lengthy form that a user needs to complete. The modal provides
                  a simple "Close" control that closes the dialog and loses all information the user
                  may already have entered in the form. However, instead of simply listening to the
                  <code>click</code> event - which in most user agents is triggered on the up-event - the author decided
                  to close the dialog on the down-event. This may lead to the user accidentally closing
                  the dialog and losing all the data they entered into the form up to that point.

                     <!-- modal dialog with a form -->

  /* close the modal dialog */
