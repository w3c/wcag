   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p> This failure demonstrates how using generic HTML elements to create user
                        interface controls can make the controls inaccessible to assistive
                        technology. Assistive technologies rely on knowledge of the role and current
                        state of a component in order to provide that information to the user. Many
                        HTML elements have well defined roles, such as links, buttons, text fields,
                        etc. Generic elements such as <code class="language-html">div</code> and <code class="language-html">span</code> do not
                        have any predefined roles. When these generic elements are used to create
                        user interface controls in HTML the assistive technology may not have the
                        necessary information to describe and interact with the control. </p>
      <p><div class="note">Attaching event handlers to elements that are not normally interactive, such
                        as <code class="language-html">span</code> and <code class="language-html">div</code>, can be disorienting to
                        users. Even if care is taken to provide keyboard access to such elements,
                        users may have a difficult time discovering that there are interactive
                        controls in the content or understanding what type of behavior to expect
                        from them. For example, users may not know which keystrokes are supported by
                        the script to activate the element. Additionally, these elements do not
                        generate the same operating system events as interactive elements, so
                        assistive technology may not be notified when the user activates them.</div></p>

   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <section class="example">
         
            <p>The following example fails because it creates a checkbox using a span and an image.</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt; 
   &lt;span onclick="toggleCheckbox('chkbox')"&gt; 
     &lt;img src="unchecked.gif" id="chkbox" alt=""&gt; Include Signature 
   &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Here is the scripting code which changes the image source when the <code class="language-html">span</code> is clicked with the mouse.</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-javascript">var CHECKED = "check.gif"; 
var UNCHECKED = "unchecked.gif"; 
function toggleCheckbox(imgId) { 
  var theImg = document.getElementById(imgId); 
  if (theImg.src.lastIndexOf(CHECKED)!= -1) {
    theImg.src = UNCHECKED; 
    // additional code to implement unchecked action 
  } 
  else { 
    theImg.src = CHECKED; 
    // additional code to implement checked action 
  } 
}</code>
</pre>
            <p> A checkbox created in this manner will not work with assistive technology since there is no information that identifies it as a checkbox. In addition, this example is also not operable from the keyboard and would fail guideline 2.1.</p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Examine the parsed source code for elements which have event handlers assigned within the mark-up or via scripting (indicating that the element is a user interface control).</li>
            <li>Check if the role of the control is already defined natively in the mark-up language.</li>
            <li>Check if another valid method, such as the assignment of a fitting WAI-ARIA role, has been used to define the role of the control.</li>
         </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <p>If check #2 AND check #3 are false, the failure condition applies.</p>
