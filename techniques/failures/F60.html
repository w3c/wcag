   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This document describes a failure that occurs when a new window is created in
                        response to a user filling in a text field for other than error reporting.
                    </p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3></h3>
         
            <p> This is a deprecated example showing a failure: A user is filling in
                                their mailing address. When they fill in their postal code, a new window
                                opens containing advertisements for services available in their city.
                            </p>
         
      </section>
      <section class="example">
         <h3></h3>
         
            <p>This example is acceptable: A user is filling in their mailing address
                                in a form. When they fill in the postal code field, a script runs to
                                validate that it is a valid postal code. If the value is not valid,
                                a window opens with instructions on how to fill in the field. </p>

         <ol>
            <li> Find all text input form fields </li>

            <li> For any new windows that open, check if they contain an error
                                    message and a button that closes the window returning focus to
                                    the initiating form element. </li>
