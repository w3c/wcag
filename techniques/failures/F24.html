      <p> All technologies that allow user agents to control foreground and background
         colors through personal stylesheets or other means. </p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Users with vision loss or cognitive, language and learning challenges often prefer specific foreground and background color combinations. In some cases, individuals with low vision will find it much easier to see a Web page that has white text on a black background, and they may have set their user agent to present this contrast. Many user agents make it possible for users to choose a preference about the foreground or background colors they would like to see without overriding all author-specified styles. This makes it possible for users to view pages where colors have not been specified by the author in their preferred color combination.</p>
      <p>Unless an author specifies both foreground and background colors, then they (the author) can no longer guarantee that the user will get a contrast that meets the contrast requirements. If, for example, the author specifies, that text should be grey, then it may override the settings of the user agent and render a page that has grey text (specified by the author) on a light grey background (that was set by the user in their user agent). This principle also works in reverse. If the author forces the background to be white, then the white background specified by the author could be similar in color to the text color preference expressed by the user in their user agent settings, thus rendering the page unusable to the user. Because an author can not predict how a user may have configured their preferences, if the author specifies a foreground text color then they should also specify a background color which has sufficient contrast with the foreground and vice versa.</p>
      <p>It is not necessary that the foreground and background colors both be defined on the same CSS rule. Since CSS color properties inherit from ancestor elements, it is sufficient if both foreground and background colors are defined either directly or through inheritance by the time that color is applied to a given element.</p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>
            Best practice is to include all states of the text. For example, text, link text, visited link text, link text with hover and keyboard focus, etc.</p>

               Background color may also be specified using a background image with the CSS property 'background-image' or with the CSS property 'background' (with the URI of the image, e.g., 'background: url("images/bg.gif")'). With background images, it is still necessary to specify a background color, because users may have images turned off in their browser. But the background image and the background color need to be checked. </p>
