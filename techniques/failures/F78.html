      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This describes a failure condition that occurs when the user agent's default visual indication of keyboard
         focus is turned off or rendered non-visible by other styling on the page without providing an author-supplied
         visual focus indicator. Turning off the focus indicator instructs the user agent not to present the focus
         indicator. Other styling may make it difficult to see the focus indicator even though it is present, such as
         outlines that look the same as the focus outline, or thick borders that are the same color as the focus
         indicator so it cannot be seen against them.</p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <section class="example">
         <h3>The focus indicator is turned off with CSS</h3>

         <p>The following CSS example will remove the default focus indicator, which fails the requirement to provide a
            visible focus indicator.</p>

         <pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-css">:focus {outline: none}</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section class="example">
         <h3>The outline of elements is visually similar to the focus indicator</h3>

         <p>The following CSS example will create an outline around links that looks the same as the focus indicator.
            This makes it impossible for users to determine which one in fact has the focus, even though the user agent
            does draw the focus indicator.</p>

         <pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-css">a {outline: thin dotted black}</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section class="example">
         <h3>Elements have a border that occludes the focus indicator</h3>

         <p>The following CSS example creates a border around links that does not have enough contrast for the focus
            indicator to be seen when drawn on top of it. In this case the focus indicator is drawn just outside the
            border, but as both are black and the border is thicker than the focus indicator, it no longer meets the
            definition of "visible".</p>

         <pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-css">a {border: medium solid black}</code></pre>
