			<p id="sc">Success Criterion 1.4.12</p>
			<p id="type">Failure</p>
		</section>
		<section id="applicability">
			<h2>Applicability</h2>
			<p>This techniques applies to text content created in markup languages that support text style properties.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this technique is to identify and test a failure condition where part of the content clips and is unreadable when the user overrides the spacing of the text within the boundaries set out in the Text Spacing success criterion. In general, this failure occurs when text is presented in a size-constrained block which does not expand if the size of the content increases. Some of the ways in which this can occur include:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
			   Setting the overflow property of the enclosing element to hidden
		      </li>
			  <li>
			   Using absolutely positioned content
		      </li>
			  <li>
			    Creating borders that are not large enough for the content when using the new font spacing
		      </li>
		  </ul>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Open the page and review the available content.</li>
          <li>Override the CSS on the page using a user style sheet or a browser plugin such as Stylus with the maximum values listed in the success criteria:
		  			<ol type="a">
              <li>Line height to at least 1.5 times the font size;</li>
		  	  		<li>Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;</li>
		  		  	<li>Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;</li>
		  			  <li>Word spacing to  0.16 times the font size.</li>
					  </ol>
          </li>
					<li>Check if there are  any content is clipped, obscured, or has any loss of content due to the new text spacing.</li>
