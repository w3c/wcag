   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p> This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving captions. If
                        the "caption" does not include all of the dialogue (either verbatim or in
                        essence) as well as all important sounds then the 'Captions' are not real
                        captions. </p>
       <div class="note">
        <p>Captions sometimes simplify the spoken text both to make it easier to read and to avoid forcing the viewer to read at very high speed. This is standard procedure and does not invalidate a caption.</p>

            <p> Examples of text streams that are not captions include: </p>
            <ul>
               <li>text that contains the dialogue (possibly simplified dialogue) but that does not describe important sounds 
                  </li>
               <li> text that omits dialogue during portions of the material </li>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li> View the material with captioning turned on. </li>
            <li> Check that all dialogue is accompanied by a caption. </li>
            <li> Check that all important sounds are captioned. </li>

         <ul>
            <li>If check #2 and check #3 are false, then this failure condition applies and the content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
