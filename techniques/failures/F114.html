      <h2>When to Use</h2>
      <p>Applies when the user causes additional content now covering other parts of content to appear by focusing an element via the keyboard or pointer hover, and cannot dismiss this additional content wuthout moving the focus</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Content elements can respond to receiving keyboard focus or pointer hiver by inserting additional content that may now cover other parts of content. For users, especially thoses using strong page magnification, this addition of content without activation can be disorienting in different ways:>(p>
        <ul>
          <li>the new content may cover content that the user may want to access</li>
          <li>The new content may not appear fully in the magnified viewport, necessitating a move of the viewport by panning or pointer focussing in order to access the new content</li>
        </ul</p>
   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Custom tooltip:</strong> When focussing an icon with a question mark set after an input field, a popup window with an explanation if the expected input appears that covers a part of the form. Pressing the ESC key or activating the pointer at the same position fails to close the submenu.</li>
        <li><strong>Sub-menu:</strong> When the mouse pointer is moved over the entry in a horizonal menubar, a submenu appears. Pressing the ESC key or activating the pointer at the same position fails to close the submenu.</li>
         <li><strong>Sub-menu:</strong> When the mouse pointer is moved over the entry in a horizonal menubar, a submenu appears over a decorative image. Across different viewport widths, the submenu does not cover information, only a part of the decorative image. This is not a failure.</li>
      </ul>

         <ol>
           <li>
             <ul>
                <li>Using the tab key, navigate through interactive content. </li>
                <li>If popup content appears that hides information, press the ESC key and check whether this closes the popup content</li>

          </li>
          <li>
             <ul>
                <li>Move the pointer over interactive elements. </li>
                <li>If popup content appears that hides information:
                  <ul>
                    <li>press the ESC key and check whether this closes the popup content</li>
                    <li>Activate the pointer device at the current pointer position</li>
                  </ul>

      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>If popup content on keyboard focus does not disappear when pressing ESC or popup content on hover does not disappear when pressing ESC or activating the pointer at the same position then this failure
                                    condition applies and content fails the success criterion.</li>
