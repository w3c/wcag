      <p> Failure due to opening new windows when the user does not expect them. New
                        windows take the focus away from what the user is reading or doing. This is
                        fine when the user has interacted with a piece of User Interface and expects
                        to get a new window, such as an options dialogue. The failure comes when
                        pop-ups appear unexpectedly. </p>

         <ol>
            <li> Load the Web page. </li>
            <li> Check if new (additional) windows open. </li>
            <li> Find every actionable element, such as links and buttons, in the
                                    Web page. </li>
            <li> Activate each element. </li>
            <li> Check if activating the element opens a new window. </li>
            <li> Check if elements that open new windows have associated text
                                    saying that will happen. The text can be displayed in the link,
                                    or available through a hidden association such as an HTML title
                                    attribute. </li>
