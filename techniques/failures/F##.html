   <h1>Failure of Success Criterion 1.2.5 due to not using available pauses in dialogue to provide audio descriptions of important visual content</h1>
   <section class="meta"><p class="id">ID: F8</p><p class="technology">Technology: failures</p><p class="type">Type: Failure</p></section>
   <section id="applicability"><h2>When to Use</h2>
      <p> Applies to all synchronized media. </p>
   </section>
   <section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving audio descriptions. Audio descriptions can either be provided as part of the soundtracks's original narration or be added to audio during pauses in existing dialogue. If actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text are only conveyed visually, appropriate pauses in dialogue must be used to provide this information as audio descriptions.</p>
       <div class="note">
        <p>Not all pauses are usable for audio descriptions. If the pauses in dialogue are too short (for instance, less than 2 seconds), or do not occur in proximity to the visual content that needs to be described, they may not be appropriate for audio descriptions.</p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>For each occurrence of synchronized time-based media:</p>
         <ol>
            <li> Check that all important visual information has been conveyed in the narration.</li>
            <li> Check that narration has been added in all appropriate pauses in the dialogue. </li>
         </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>If checks 1 and 2 are false, then this failure condition applies and the content fails the success criterion.</li>
         </ul>
