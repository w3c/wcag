            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Whether a user interface component has focus is a particularly important facet of
               its state. Many types of assistive technology rely on tracking the current keyboard
               focus. Screen readers will move the user's point of regard to the focused user interface
               component, and screen magnifiers will change the display of the content so that the
               focused component is visible. If assistive technology is not notified when focus moves
               to a new component, the user will become confused when they attempt to interact with
               the wrong component.
            </p>
            <p>While user agents usually handle this functionality for standard controls, custom-scripted
               user interface components are responsible for using accessibility APIs to make focus
               information and notifications available.
            </p>
         </section>
         <section id="examples">
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>A custom menu displays menu items by rendering them explicitly, handling mouse and
               key events directly and highlighting the currently selected menu item. The programmer
               does not expose the menu item that has focus via the Accessibility API, so assistive
               technology can only determine that focus is somewhere within the menu and cannot determine
               which menu item has focus.
