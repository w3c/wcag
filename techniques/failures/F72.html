   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this failure condition is to avoid the use of <a>ASCII art</a> when a text alternative is not provided. Although ASCII art is implemented as a character string, its meaning comes from the pattern of glyphs formed by a visual presentation of that string, not from the text itself. Therefore ASCII art is non-text content and requires a text alternative. Text alternatives, or links to them, should be placed near the ASCII art in order to be associated with it.</p>

         <h3> ASCII Art chart without a text alternative </h3>
         
            <p>The following ASCII art chart lacks a text alternative and therefore does not meet Success Criterion 1.1.1. Note this failure example does in fact cause this page to fail, but you may <a href="#F72-related-techs">skip over the example</a>.</p>
