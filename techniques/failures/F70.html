      <p>Markup languages: HTML, XHTML, and other SGML or XML-based technologies.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this failure is to identify examples of markup errors in element tags that could cause assistive technology to be unable to generate a satisfactory model of the page. Different user agents may implement different heuristics to recover from errors, resulting in inconsistent presentations of the page between user agents.</p>
      <p>Some common types of problems with start and end tags that lead to this failure condition (though this is not an exhaustive list):</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Opening and closing tags that are missing the opening &lt; and closing &gt; brackets.</li>
         <li>Closing tag missing the initial / to indicate it is a closing tag.</li>
         <li>Attribute values that have an opening quote but not a closing quote. Attribute values must be either fully quoted or, in some markup languages, may be unquoted.</li>
         <li>Lack of whitespace between attributes.</li>
         <li>Unquoted attribute values that have whitespace in the value.</li>
         <li>Failure to provide a closing element tag for elements that do not accept empty-element syntax.</li>
      </ul>
