         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> This document describes a failure that occurs when the content in the main <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-viewport">viewport</a> viewport is automatically updated, and there is no option for a user to disable this
               behavior. 
            </p>
            <p>Two procedures are presented below to test for the existence of a failure against
               Success Criterion 3.2.5. Procedure 1 is the preferred procedure and assumes that content
               authors have access to the code that generates the viewport content.
            </p>
            <p>However there may be instances where this may not be possible (eg: in certain content
               management systems, application environments such as django or ruby-on-rails, or content
               generated through scripting languages such as AJAX or PHP that are generated by third
               parties.) To that end, the second procedure is supplied to allow testing in these
               instances. Note that timeframes are indicative only, and that any change after any
               amount of time should be treated as a failure if the test otherwise does not pass
               the other step evaluations.
