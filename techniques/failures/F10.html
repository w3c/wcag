      <p>Applies when content creates a situation where the user can enter the content
                        using the keyboard, but cannot exit the content using the keyboard.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>When content includes multiple formats, one or more user agents or plug-ins
                        are often needed in order to successfully present the content to users. For
                        example, a page that includes HTML, SVG, SMIL and XForms may require a
                        browser to load as many as three different plug-ins in order for a user to
                        successfully interact with the content. Some plug-ins create a common
                        situation in which the keyboard focus can become "stuck" in a
                        plug-in, leaving a keyboard-only user with no way to return to the
                        other content. </p>
   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
         <li> 
               <strong>A plug-in traps the user: </strong>A user tabs into a
                                plug-in and is unable to return to content outside the plug-in
                                content with the keyboard. The user has to restart their browser in
                                order to regain control and navigate to a new page and is unable to
                                access any content that appears beyond the plug-in content. </li>
      </ul>
   </section><section id="tests"><h2>Tests</h2>
      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li> Using a keyboard, navigate through the content. </li>
            <li> Check to see that the keyboard focus is not "trapped" and it is
                                    possible to move keyboard focus out of the plug-in content
                                    without closing the user agent or restarting the system. </li>
         </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li> If the keyboard focus becomes "trapped," then this failure
                                    condition applies and content fails the Success Criterion and conformance requirement 5. </li>
