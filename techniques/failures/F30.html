   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p> This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving text
                        alternatives. If the text in the "text alternative" cannot be used in place
                        of the non-text content without losing information or function then it fails
                        because it is not, in fact, an alternative to the non-text content. </p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p> Examples of text that are not text alternatives include: </p>
            <ul>
               <li> placeholder text such as " " or "spacer" or "image" or
                                        "picture" etc that are put into the 'text alternative'
                                        location on images or pictures. </li>
               <li> programming references that do not convey the information or
                                        function of the non-text content such as "picture 1",
                                        "picture 2" or "0001", "0002" or "Intro#1", "Intro#2". </li>
               <li> filenames that are not valid text alternatives in their own
                                        right such as "Oct.jpg" or "Chart.jpg" or
                                        "sales\\oct\\top3.jpg" </li>

         <ol>
            <li> Check each text alternative to see if it is not actually a text
                                    alternative for the non-text content. </li>

         <ul>
            <li> If check #1 is true then this failure condition applies and content
                                    fails the Success Criterion. </li>
