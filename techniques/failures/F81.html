         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.2 success criteria. The Applicability section explains the scope of the technique,
            and the presence of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology
            can be used in all situations to create content that meets WCAG 2.2.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This objective of this technique is to describe the failure that occurs when a required
               field or an error field is marked with color differences only, without an alternate
               way to identify the required field or error field. This can cause problems for people
               who are blind or colorblind, because they may not be able to perceive the color differences
               that indicate which field is required or which field is causing an error.
            </p>

         <section id="examples">
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A user is completing an online form, and the phone number field is required. To indicate
                  that the phone number field is required, the label "Phone Number" is displayed in
                  a color different from the color used for optional fields, without any other indication
                  that "Phone Number" is a required field. A blind or colorblind user may not be able
                  to identify that "Phone Number" is a required field.
               </li>
               
               <li>A user submits an online form and leaves a required field blank, resulting in an error.
                  The form field that caused the error is indicated by red text only, without an additional
                  non-color indication that the field caused an error.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>In both examples, the color could be used without failure if the text was sufficiently
                     different in visual presentation (e.g. bold or in a different font) that it would
                     be easily differentiated from the surrounding text if the color were removed. It would
                     also not fail if the color chosen had sufficient luminosity difference (lightness)
                     from the other text that it would be easily be seen as different if viewed in black
                     and white.  In these cases - the information would not be displayed in color (hue)
                     alone but also in "presentation" or "lightness" respectively.
