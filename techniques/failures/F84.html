         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This failure describes a common condition where links such as "click here" or "more"
               are used as anchor elements where you need to have the surrounding text to understand
               their purpose and where there isn't any mechanism to make the destination clear by
               itself, such as a button to expand the link text.
            </p>
            <p>Many blind people who use screen readers call up a dialog box that has a list of links
               from the page. They use this list of links to decide where they will go. But if many
               of the links in that list simply say "click here" or "more" they will be unable to
               use this feature in their screen reader, which is a core navigation strategy. That's
               why it's a failure of 2.4.9 to not provide any way of allowing them to know the destination
               from the link text alone. It is also true for people who tab through links. If all
               they hear as they tab through the document is "click here, click here, click here
               etc." they will become confused.
