   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to describe a failure that occurs when
                        structural markup is used to achieve a presentational effect, but indicates
                        relationships that do not exist in the content. This is disorienting to
                        users who are depending on those relationships to navigate the content or to
                        understand the relationship of one piece of the content to another. Note
                        that the use of HTML tables for layout is not an example of this failure as
                        long as the layout table does not include improper structural markup such as
                            &lt;th&gt; or &lt;caption&gt;
                        elements.</p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>Though an element's semantic meaning is generally exposed to AT, the WAI-ARIA presentation role can be used to suppress the native semantics of an element so that they are not mapped to the accessibility API. Setting an element's <code class="att">role</code> to presentation may avoid this failure by hiding that element's semantics from the user.</p>

                                document, however, so it should not be marked as a heading.</p>

         <h3>Using heading elements for presentational effect</h3>
         
            <p>In this example, heading markup is used in two different ways: to
                                convey document structure and to create visual effects. The
                                h1 and h2 elements are used appropriately
                                to mark the beginning of the document as a whole and the beginning
                                of the abstract. However, the h3 and h4
                                elements between the title and the abstract are used only for visual
                                effect — to control the fonts used to display the authors' names and
                                the date.</p>
