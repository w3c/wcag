            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Web servers that require user authentication usually have a session mechanism
               in which a session times out after a period of inactivity from the user.
               This is sometimes done for security reasons, to protect users who are
               assumed to have left their computer exposed in a state where someone could
               do something harmful to them such as transfer bank funds or make an
               unauthorized purchase. A user with a disability may actually still be
               working to complete the form as it may take him or her longer to complete
               the form than would normally be expected. Upon re-authentication, if the
               state of the user's session is not restored, including all data that had
               been previously entered into the form, he or she will have to start over.
               And for these users, it is likely that the session will time out again
               before they can complete the form. This sets up a situation where a user who
               needs more time to complete the form can never complete it.

            <ul>
               
               <li>A user submits a form on an authenticated site after their login has
                  expired. On submitting the form, they are prompted to log in again,
                  and then taken to a general welcome page. The data is not processed
                  and they must try again.

               <li>A user submits a form on an authenticated site after their login has
                  expired. On submitting the form, they are prompted to log in again,
                  and then taken back to the page they were on just before the login,
                  which in this case contains the form they attempted to submit.
                  However, the form is not populated with the data they just entered,
                  and they must re-enter it.
