      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This describes a failure condition for Success Criteria involving sound. If sound does not
         turn off automatically within 3 seconds and there is no way to turn the
         sound off, independently from the overall system volume level, then Success Criterion 1.4.2 would not be met.
         The sound would fall within this failure condition. </p>
