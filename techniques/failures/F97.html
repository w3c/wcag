			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p>All technologies that allow the viewing of content to be restricted to one orientation.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to describe how restricting the view of content to a single orientation is a failure to allow content to be viewed in multiple orientations. When content is presented with a restriction to a specific orientation, users must orient their devices to view the content in the orientation that the author imposed. Some users have their devices mounted in a fixed orientation (e.g. on the arm of a power wheelchair), and if the content cannot be viewed in that orientation it creates problems for the user.</p>
      
      <p>If a specific orientation is determined to be <a>essential</a> for the operation and viewing of the content, then this failure technique will not apply.</p>

		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
		 			<ul>
 				<li>A news app always shows the content in portrait orientation. Users can view the content on a device which supports landscape and portrait display orientations. When the device is turned to landscape view, the content appears sideways to the user.</li>
 			    </ul>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Open the content in landscape view. Check that the content is oriented for this view.</li>
          <li>Open the content in portrait view. Check that the content is oriented for this view.</li>
					<li>Check if portrait or landscape view is essential for the viewing and operation of the content.</li>
          <li>If there are any controls in the content, user agent, operating system, or device that restrict or allow orientation changes, check that the controls can be set to allow checks #1 and #2 to be true.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If check #1 or check #2 is false, and checks #3 and #4 are false, then this failure condition applies and content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
				</ul>
