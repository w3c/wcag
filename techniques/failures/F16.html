      <p>All technologies that support visual movement or scrolling.</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>In this failure technique, there is moving or scrolling content that cannot
                        be paused and resumed by users. In this case, some users with low vision or
                        cognitive disabilities will not be able to perceive the content.</p>
   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>A page has a scrolling news ticker without a mechanism to pause it.
                                Some users are unable to read the scrolling content.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>On a page with moving or scrolling content,</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Check that a mechanism is provided in the Web page or user agent
                                    to pause moving or scrolling content.</li>
            <li>Use the pause mechanism to pause the moving or scrolling
                                content.</li>
            <li>Check that the moving or scrolling has stopped and does not
                                    restart by itself.</li>
            <li>Check that a mechanism is provided in the Web page or user agent
                                    to restart the paused content.</li>
            <li>Use the restart mechanism provided to restart the moving
                                content.</li>
            <li>Check that the movement or scrolling has resumed from the point
                                    where it was stopped.</li>
         </ol>

      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>If  step #1, step #3, step #4, or step #6 are false, then the content fails the success
                                    criterion.</li>
