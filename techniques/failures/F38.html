      <p> This describes a failure condition for text alternatives for images that
                        should be ignored by AT. If there is no alt attribute at all assistive
                        technologies are not able to ignore the non-text content. The alt attribute
                        must be provided and have a null value (i.e., alt="" ) to avoid a failure of this Success Criterion. </p>
      <p>This describes a failure condition for text alternatives for images that should be ignored by assistive technology (AT). If an image has the attribute role="presentation", it will be ignored by AT. However, if it does not have role="presentation", and if there is no <code class="language-html">alt</code> attribute at all assistive technologies are not able to ignore the image. For decorative images which need to be ignored by AT, either role="presentation" must be used or the alt attribute must be provided and have a null value (i.e., alt="") to avoid a failure of this Success Criterion.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Decorative images that have no <code class="language-html">alt</code>
                                attribute and no <code class="language-html">role</code> attribute

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>For any <code class="language-html">img</code> element that is used for purely decorative content:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Check whether the element has no <code class="language-html">role</code> attribute or has a <code class="language-html">role</code> attribute value that is not <code class="language-html">presentation</code>.</li>
            <li>Check whether the element has no <code class="language-html">alt</code> attribute or has an <code class="language-html">alt</code> attribute with a value that is not null.</li>
         </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>If check #1 and #2 are true, this failure condition applies and content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
         </ul>
