            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to describe how using white space
               characters, such as space, tab, line break, or carriage return, to format columns
               of
               data in text content is a failure to use structure properly. Assistive
               technologies will interpret content in the reading order of the current
               language. Using white space characters to create multiple columns does not
               provide the information in a natural reading order. Thus, the assistive
               technology user will not be presented with the information in an
               understandable manner.
            </p>
            <p>Plain text is not suitable for displaying multiple columns of text. Modify
               the content to present the data in a different layout. Alternatively, use a
               technology that provides structural elements to represent columnar data.
