   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to describe how using white space
                        characters, such as space, tab, line break, or carriage return, to format columns of
                        data in text content is a failure to use structure properly. Assistive
                        technologies will interpret content in the reading order of the current
                        language. Using white space characters to create multiple columns does not
                        provide the information in a natural reading order. Thus, the assistive
                        technology user will not be presented with the information in an
                        understandable manner.</p>
      <p>Plain text is not suitable for displaying multiple columns of text. Modify
                        the content to present the data in a different layout. Alternatively, use a
                        technology that provides structural elements to represent columnar data.</p>
