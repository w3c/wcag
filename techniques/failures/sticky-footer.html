				<h2>Applicability</h2>
					<p>Content using any technology which supports keyboard interfaces.</p>

				<section id="description">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The objective of this failure is to avoid situations in which people using a keyboard interface (e.g. tabbing through links and controls) cannot see where the indicator is due to other authored content.</p>

				<p>Any 'sticky' content that moves with the viewport can potentially obscure other elements on the page, including controls the user may tab to.</p>

				<h2>Examples</h2>
		
				<section class="example" id="example-1">
					<h3>Sticky footer</h3>
					<p>A Web page has a sticky footer, an element that stays visible at the bottom of the viewport as the user scrolls the page. The footer is tall enough to completely cover the element in focus as a user tabs down the page.</p>       
				
				</section>

                <section class="example" id="example-1">
					<h3>Sticky header</h3>
					<p>A Web page has a sticky header, an element the width of the viewport and stays visible at the top of the viewport. The header is tall enough to completely cover the element in focus as a user tabs up the page.</p>

				<h2>Tests</h2>
		
				<section class="test-procedure">
					<h3>Procedure</h3>
                    <p>Tab through the links and controls on the page. Both progressing down through the page, and back up:</p>
					<ol>
					  <li>Check whether the focused element is completely obscured by other content</li>
					</ol>

				<section class="test-results">
					<h3>Expected Results</h3>
		
					<ul>
						<li>If #1 is true, then this failure condition applies and the content fails this Success Criterion.</li>
