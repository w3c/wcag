      <p>The objective of this failure is to avoid situations in which synchronized media alternatives provide more information than the text for which they are alternatives, but do not provide their own text alternatives to provide access to the extra information. Synchronized media alternatives provide enhanced access to users for whom synchronized media is a more effective format than text. Since they are alternatives to text, they do not need themselves to have redundant text alternatives in the form of captions, audio descriptions or full text alternatives. However, if they provide more information than the text for which they are an alternative, then they are not just alternatives but are synchronized media content in their own right. In this case they are subject to the full requirements of <a href="../../Understanding/captions-prerecorded">Success Criterion 1.2.2</a> to provide captions and to <a href="../../Understanding/audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded">Success Criterion 1.2.3</a>, and <a href="../../Understanding/audio-description-prerecorded">Success Criterion 1.2.5</a>.</p>

         <ol>
            <li>Check for captions on synchronized media alternatives.</li>

                  <p>Synchronized media alternatives often use different words to present what is on the page but it should not present new information on the topic of the page.</p>
