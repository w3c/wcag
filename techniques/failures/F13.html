            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to describe the failure that occurs when
               an image uses color differences to convey information, but the text alternative for
               the
               image does not convey that information. This can cause problems for people
               who are blind or colorblind because they will not be able to perceive the
               information conveyed by the color differences.

            <ul>
               
               <li>A bar chart of sales data is provided as an image. The chart includes
                  yearly sales figures for four employees in the Sales Department. The
                  text alternative for the image says, "The following bar chart
                  displays the yearly sales figures for the Sales Department. Mary
                  sold 3.1 Million; Fred, 2.6 Million; Bob, 2.2 Million; and Andrew,
                  3.4 Million. The red bars indicate sales that were below the yearly
                  quota". This text alternative fails to provide the information which
                  is conveyed by the color red in the image. The alternative should
                  indicate which people did not meet the sales quota rather than
                  relying on color.
