      <p>When pointing device-specific event handlers are the only mechanism available
                        to invoke a function of the content, users with no vision (who cannot use
                        devices such as mice that require eye-hand coordination) as well as users
                        who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard
                        emulators will be unable to access the function of the content. </p>
                      
                      <p>For Success Criterion 2.1.1 there is an exception for functions that require a path-dependant pointer movement.</p>

         <ol>
            <li>Check to see whether pointing-device-specific event handlers are the only means to invoke scripting functions.</li>
           <li>Check if the function being invoked requires input information about a specific path for a pointing device</li>

         <ul>
            <li>If check #1 is true, then this failure condition applies and content fails Success Criterion 2.1.3.</li>
            <li>If check #1 is true and check #2 is false, then this failure condition applies and content fails Success Criteria 2.1.1 and 2.1.3.</li>
