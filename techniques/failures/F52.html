   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p> Some Web sites open a new window when a page is loaded, to advertise a
                        product or service. The objective of this technique is to ensure that pages
                        do not disorient users by opening up one or more new windows that automatically attain focus as soon as a
                        page is loaded. </p>

      <div class="note">
         <p>There are multiple methods by which this failure may be triggered. Two
                            common examples that are supported differently in various versions of
                            user agents are listed as examples below. </p>
