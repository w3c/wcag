    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Requiring users to authenticate by entering a password or passcode in a different format from which it was originally created is a failure to meet Success Criteria 3.3.8 and 3.3.9 (unless alternative authentication methods are available). A password in this context could be a password, passcode, passphrase or any string of characters the user has to remember or record to authenticate.</p>

    <p>If a user is required to enter individual password characters across multiple fields, in a way that prevents pasting the password in a single action, it prevents use of a password manager or pasting from local copy of the password. This means users cannot avoid transcription, resulting in a <a href="../../understanding/22/accessible-authentication.html#dfn-cognitive-function-test">cognitive function test</a>. This applies irrespective of whether users are required to enter all characters in the string, or just a subset.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>These examples would prevent a user from entering a password in the same format in which the password was originally created:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A fieldset that prompts a user to "Enter the 2nd, 6th and last characters of your password", with separate input fields for each character.</li>
        <li>A fieldset that prompts a user to enter each digit of a password in a separate input (unless the user can paste the entire password in the first input, and the remaining inputs are populated automatically).</li>
        <li>A password input fieldset composed of <code class="el">&lt;select&gt;</code> elements that requires a user to select each character of a fixed-length password from individual dropdown fields.</li>
    </ul>

   <section id="tests"><h2>Tests</h2>
      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>For each form field which accepts password entry:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Check if the structure of the input field(s) prevents the user from pasting or auto-filling the entire password in the format in which it was originally created.</li>
            <li>Confirm that no other acceptable authentication methods are present that satisfy Success Criteria 3.3.8 or 3.3.9 (such as an authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test).</li>
         </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="results"><h3>Expected Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>If steps #1 and #2 are true, then this failure condition applies and content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
         </ul>
