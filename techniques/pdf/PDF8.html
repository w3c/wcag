			<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide an expansion or definition of an abbreviation for the first occurrence of the abbreviation. For example, a reference to an abbreviation, such as "<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>", should be available as "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)" on its first occurrence in a document.</p>
      <p>This is done by setting expansion text using an <code>/E</code> entry for a structure element, and is normally accomplished using a tool for authoring PDF. A <code>Span</code> structure element is typically used to tag the abbreviation, but the <code>/E</code> entry is valid with any structure element.</p>
      <p>This technique is applicable for any abbreviation, including acronyms and initialisms. Note that on the first occurrence of the abbreviation, both the abbreviation and the expansion text must be provided. This will aid recognition of later use of the abbreviation.</p>
      <p>PDF documents may be enhanced by providing expansions for abbreviations. In fact, such expansions are required for accessibility to ensure understanding by people who have difficulty decoding words; rely on screen magnification (which may obscure context); have limited memory; or who have difficulty using context to aid understanding.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Adding an <code>/E</code> entry to an abbreviation using Adobe Acrobat Pro's Tags panel</h3>
				<p>This example is shown with Adobe Acrobat Pro. There are other software tools that perform similar functions.</p>
				<p>In a tagged PDF document:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Select View &#8594; Show/Hide &#8594; Navigation Panes &#8594; Accessibility Tags.</li>
					<li>Select the first instance of the abbreviated text that needs to be expanded. If the selected text is part of a larger tag, use the Accessibility Tags panel's "Create Tag from Selection", and create a new <code>Span</code> tag. In this example, the text "WCAG2.2" (within the <code>LBody</code> tag) has been enclosed in a <code>Span</code> tag.</li>
					<li>In the Tags panel, access the context menu for the spanned text and select Properties...</li>
					<li>In the Content tab of the Properties dialog, enter the expansion text, followed by the originally selected text.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The following image illustrates this technique:</p>

					<img alt="The addition of expansion text to an abbreviation using the Accessibility Tags panel. The text 'WCAG2.2' has been selected and a Span tag created for it.

				<h3>Using a <code>/Span</code> structure element with an <span>/E</span> entry to define an abbreviation</h3>
				<p>The following code fragment illustrates code that is typical for using the <code>/Span</code> structure element to define an abbreviation.</p>
				<p>This example uses the sentence "Sugar is commonly sold in 5 lb bags." The abbreviation "lb" is tagged as a <code>/Span</code> structure element with an <code>/E</code> entry (typically accomplished by an authoring tool).</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code>1 0 obj                                  % structure element
  &lt;&lt; /Type /StructElemen
           /S /Span                      % element type
           /P ...                        % Parent in structure hierarchy

				<h3>Using a <code>/TH</code> structure element with an <code>/E</code> entry to define an abbreviation</h3>
				<p>As noted in the Description, the <code>/E</code> entry is valid with any structure element.</p>
				<p>The following code fragment illustrates code that is typical for using an <code>/E</code> entry to define an abbreviation.</p>
				<p>A table that contains columns for each month uses abbreviations as the values of column headers. The expansion for each abbreviation is provided as the <code>/E</code> entry of the <code>/TH</code> structure element (typically accomplished by an authoring tool).</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code>1 0 obj                                  % structure element
  &lt;&lt; /Type /StructElemen

			<h2>Tests</h2>
      <section class="procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Verify that the first occurrence of abbreviations that require
    					expansion text have /E entries on an enclosing tag by one of the
    					following and that both the abbreviation and the expansion text are
    					provided:</p>
            <ul>
							<li>In a PDF editor, locate the tag for the text that is the abbreviation, and check that an expansion or definition is provided for each abbreviation in the Expansion Text field in the corresponding tag's properties.</li>
              <li>Read the PDF document with a screen reader, listening to hear that on the first occurrence, the abbreviation and expansion are read when the screen reader reads the content line-by-line.</li>
              <li>Use a tool that is capable of showing the <code>/E</code> entry value, such as aDesigner to open the PDF document and view the <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> summary to read the text expansions for abbreviations.</li>
              <li>Use a tool that exposes the document through the accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> and verify that the text expansion of the abbreviation is properly implemented.</li>
           </ul>
          </li>
