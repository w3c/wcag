			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to provide text alternatives for
		images via an <code>/Alt</code> entry in the property list for a Tag. This is normally
		accomplished using a tool for authoring PDF.</p>
		<p>PDF documents may be enhanced by providing alternative descriptions
			for images, formulas, and other items that do not translate naturally
			into text. In fact, such text alternatives are required for accessibility:
			alternate descriptions are human-readable text that can be vocalized
			by text-to-speech technology for the benefit of users with vision disabilities. </p>
			<p>When an image contains words that are important to understanding the
				content, the text alternative should include those words. This will
				allow the alternative to accurately represent the image. Note that
				it does not necessarily describe the visual characteristics of the
				image itself but must convey the same meaning as the image.</p>

					<h3>Adding a text alternative to an image in a PDF document using an <code>/Alt</code> entry</h3>
					<p>The <code>/Alt</code> property used on an image of mountains with a moon and trees typically would be used like this (typically accomplished by an authoring tool):</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">/Figure &lt;&lt;/Alt (Sketch of Mountains with moon rising over trees)&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>The image might also be represented by a tag with a different name. A different name might be used because the tag name is written in a language other than English or because a specific tool uses a different name for some other reason. In this situation, it is also necessary that the <code>RoleMap</code> contained within the <code>StructTreeRoot</code> for the PDF document contain an entry which explicitly maps the name of the tag used for the image with the standard structure type used in PDF documents (in this case, Figure). If the RoleMap contains only an entry mapping Shape tags to Figure tags, the <code>rolemap</code> information would appear as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">/RoleMap &lt;&lt; /Shape /Figure &gt;&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>In this case, the usage of the <code>/Alt</code> entry as follows would also be correct:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">/Shape &lt;&lt;/Alt (Crater Lake in the summer, with the blue sky, clouds and
 crater walls perfectly reflected in the lake) &gt;&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>Note that the <code>/Alt</code> entry in property lists can be combined with other entries.</p>

				<h2>Tests</h2>
				<section class="procedure">
					<h3>Procedure</h3>
					<p>For all images which need equivalents:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>Verify the images have <code>/Alt</code> entries on an enclosing tag by one of the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Read the PDF document with a screen reader, listening to hear that the equivalent text is read when tabbing to the non-text object (if it is tabbable) or hearing the alternative text read when reading the content line-by-line.</li>
								<li>Using a PDF editor, check that a text alternative is displayed for each image.</li>
								<li>Use a tool which is capable of showing the <code>/Alt</code> entry value, such as aDesigner, to open the PDF document and view the <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> summary to read the text alternatives for images.</li>
								<li>Use a tool that exposes the document through the accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> and verify that images have required text equivalents.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
