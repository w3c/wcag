			<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The intent of this technique is to ensure that users can navigate
    				through content in a logical order that is consistent with the meaning
    				of the content. Correct tab and reading order is typically accomplished
    				using a tool for authoring PDF.</p>
      <p>For sighted users, the logical order of PDF content is also the visual
    				order on the screen. For keyboard and assistive technology users, the
    				tab order through content, including interactive elements (form fields
    				and links), determines the order in which these users can navigate
    				the content. The tab order must reflect the logical order of the document. </p>
      <p>Logical structure is created when a document is saved as tagged PDF.
    				The reading order of a PDF document is determined primarily by the tag order of document elements, including interactive elements, but the order of content within individual tags is determined by the PDF document's content tree structure.</p>
      <p>If the reading order is not correct, keyboard and assistive technology
    				users may not be able to understand the content. For example, some
    				documents use multiple columns, and the reading order is clear visually
    				to sighted users as flowing from the top to the bottom of the first
    				column, then to the top of the next column. But if the document is
    				not properly tagged, a screen reader may read the document from top
    				to bottom, across both columns, interpreting them as one column.</p>
      <p>The simplest way to ensure correct reading order is to structure the
    				document correctly in the authoring tool used to create the document,
    				before conversion to tagged PDF. Note, however, that pages with complex
    				layouts with graphics, tables, footnotes, side-bars, form fields, and
    				other elements may not convert to tagged PDF in the correct reading
    				order. These inconsistencies must then be corrected with repair tools
    				such as Acrobat Pro.</p>
      <p>When a PDF document containing form fields has a correct reading order,
    				all form fields are contained in the tab order in the appropriate order,
    				and in the correct order relative to other content in the PDF. Common
    				tab-order errors include:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Form fields missing from the tagged content.</li>
         <li>Form fields in the wrong location in the PDF content; e.g., at
    				the end of non-interactive content.</li>
      </ul>
