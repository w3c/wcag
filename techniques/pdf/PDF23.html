			<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that interactive form controls in PDF documents allow keyboard operation. Interactive PDF forms are generally created using a tool for authoring PDF.</p>
      <p>The types of PDF form controls are: text input field, check box, radio button, combo box, list box, and button.</p>
      <p>Form controls allow users to interact with a PDF document by filling
    				in information or indicating choices, which can then be submitted
    				for processing. Users who rely on keyboard access must be able to
    				recognize and understand the form fields, make selections, and provide
    				input to complete the forms, and submit the form, just as sighted
    				users can.</p>
      <p>Interactive form controls can be provided for forms created by
    				converting a scanned paper form to tagged PDF or by creating a form
    				in an authoring application such as Microsoft Word or Open Office
    				and converting it to tagged PDF.</p>
      <p>However, documents created by authoring applications that provide
    				form design features might not fully retain their fillable form
    				fields on conversion to PDF. Complex forms in particular may not
    				have properly converted form fields and labels when tagged in conversion.</p>
      <p>Using Adobe Acrobat Pro with forms in converted documents, you
    				can ensure that form fields are keyboard accessible and usable by:</p>
      <ul>
				<li>Opening tagged PDF documents with form fields and creating interactive PDF form elements with the Run Form Fields Recognition tool.</li>
         <li>Modifying fillable form fields, or adding form fields, using Adobe Acrobat Pro</li>
      </ul>

		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<section class="example">
			<h3>Adding interactive controls to existing forms in PDF documents using Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro</h3>
			<p>This example is shown with Adobe Acrobat Pro. There are other software tools that perform similar functions.</p>
			<p>If you have a form in a tagged PDF document (created by scanning a paper form or using an authoring tool to generate tagged PDF), you can use Adobe Acrobat Pro to make the form elements keyboard accessible in the same page locations as the static form.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Use Advanced &#8594; Accessibility &#8594; Run Form Field Recognition to automatically detect form fields and make them fillable.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The following image shows the Run Form Field Recognition tool is selected to detect form fields in a document converted to tagged PDF.</p>
