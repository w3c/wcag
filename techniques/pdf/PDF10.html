			<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users of assistive
    				technology are able to perceive form control labels and understand
    				how form controls are used. </p>
      <p>Form controls allow users to interact with a PDF document by filling
    				in information or indicating choices which can then be submitted for
    				processing. Assistive technology users must be able to recognize and
    				understand the form fields, make selections, and provide input to complete
    				the forms, and submit the form, just as sighted users can. Understandable
    				labels that convey the purpose of each form control are essential to
    				form accessibility. </p>
      <p>Form inputs generally have labels and instructions to help users understand
    				what information is required and how to fill in the form. Unless these
    				labels are programmatically associated with the relevant fields, assistive
    				technology might not be able to associate them correctly, and thus
    				users might not understand how to complete the form. </p>
      <p>Using Adobe Acrobat Pro with documents with interactive forms, you
    				can make sure that the forms are accessible and usable by making sure
    				that programmatically associated labels that convey the purpose of
    				the fields are provided. </p>
      <p>The heuristics used by assistive technology will sometimes use the
    				text label if a programmatically associated label cannot be found.
    				The TU entry (which is the tooltip) of the
    				field dictionary is the programmatically
    				associated label. Therefore, add a tooltip to each field to provide
    				a label that assistive technology can interpret.</p>

						<h2>Examples</h2>
						<section class="example">
							<h3>Providing labels using the Forms tool in Adobe Acrobat Pro</h3>
							<p>This example is shown with Adobe Acrobat Pro. There are other software tools that perform similar functions.</p>
            <p>As noted in the Description, text labels added in an authoring tool
    						and then converted to PDF might be visually associated with the fields
    						but are not programmatically associated, and you should provide a tooltip. </p>
            <ol>
               <li>Select the Prepare Form tool.</li>
               <li>For the field you want to edit, access the context menu and select the Properties dialog.</li>
               <li>In the General tab of the Properties dialog, type a description for the form field in the Tooltip field.</li>
               <li>Repeat for all form fields.</li>
            </ol>
            <div>

						<h3>Adding a tooltip to interactive form controls</h3>
            <p>The following code fragment illustrates the use of the TU entry to
    						provide a tooltip (or programmatically associated text label) for a
    						form field. This is typically accomplished by an authoring tool. </p>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>For each form control, verify visually that the label is positioned correctly in relation to the control.</li>
            <li>For each form control, verify that the name is programmatically associated with the control by one of the following:
							<ul>
								<li>Open the PDF document with a tool that is capable of showing the name associated with the control and verify that the name is associated correctly with the control.</li>
								<li>Use a tool that exposes the document through the accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, and verify that the name is associated correctly with the control.</li>
