            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users of assistive
               				technology are able to perceive form control labels and understand
               				how form controls are used. 
            </p>
            <p>Form controls allow users to interact with a PDF document by filling
               				in information or indicating choices which can then be submitted for
               				processing. Assistive technology users must be able to recognize and
               				understand the form fields, make selections, and provide input to complete
               				the forms, and submit the form, just as sighted users can. Understandable
               				labels that convey the purpose of each form control are essential to
               				form accessibility. 
            </p>
            <p>Form inputs generally have labels and instructions to help users understand
               				what information is required and how to fill in the form. Unless these
               				labels are programmatically associated with the relevant fields, assistive
               				technology might not be able to associate them correctly, and thus
               				users might not understand how to complete the form. 
            </p>
            <p>Using Adobe Acrobat Pro with documents with interactive forms, you
               				can make sure that the forms are accessible and usable by making sure
               				that programmatically associated labels that convey the purpose of
               				the fields are provided. 
            </p>
            <p>The heuristics used by assistive technology will sometimes use the
               				text label if a programmatically associated label cannot be found.
               				The TU entry (which is the tooltip) of the
               				field dictionary is the programmatically
               				associated label (see Example
               				3 below and Table 220 in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
                  				1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</a>). Therefore, add a tooltip to each field to provide
               				a label that assistive technology can interpret.

               <h3>Placement rules</h3>
               
               <p>The table below lists the placement rules governing where Adobe LiveCycle
                  					positions labels by default. Note that these rules assume left-to-right
                  					text directionality. If your form requires different positioning (e.g.,
                  					to accommodate PDF documents in languages that use right-to-left text
                  					directionality), see <em>Repositioning form labels</em> in Example
                  					2 below. In general, authors should review label positioning to make
                  					sure it meets the requirements of their particular form.

                  <p>The label that a screen reader uses does not necessarily have to be
                     							the same as the visual caption. In some cases, you may want to provide
                     							more information about a form element's purpose. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>To specify what text should be announced by the screen reader for
                     							a particular object, you can use the Accessibility Palette's Screen
                     							Reader Precedence drop down list. Text is announced in the order shown
                     							in the list: custom text, tool tip, caption, and name. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Depending on the complexity and difficulty of your form, you must
                     							decide which option best suits the requirements for your form. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>By default, a screen reader searches for an object's text in order
                     							shown in the image. Once descriptive text has been found for a control,
                     							the search stops. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The image below shows an example of a text field with a visual caption
                     							that might be unclear for screen reader users. One of the fields has
                     							a caption of "Date" but screen reader users may want to know
                     							the preferred date format (shown as screen text). So this text is provided
                     							in the tooltip. Because a tooltip has a higher precedence than the
                     							visual caption, the screen reader uses the tooltip. 
                  </p>

                        							Text box, type the speak text for the group. For example, type   "Select

                        									button. For example, type "Cash."

                  <h4>Repositioning form labels</h4>
                  
                  <p>The placement of a caption, or label, is important because users expect
                     							them to be found at a particular location adjacent to the control.
                     							For screen magnification users this is even more important, as they
                     							might not be able to view both the control and the label at the same
                     							time. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>When you create an object, Adobe LiveCycle Designer automatically
                     							positions the label as specified by the control type (see the table
                     							in the Description above). For example, for a text field, the label
                     							is positioned to the left of the control. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>If you need to change the position of the label text (for example,
                     							to accommodate right-to-left text directionality): 
                  </p>
                  
                  <ol>
                     
                     <li> Select the object by moving the focus to it. </li>
                     
                     <li> In the Layout palette, under Caption at the bottom of the palette,
                        							select the position of your object from the Position drop-down list. 
                     </li>
