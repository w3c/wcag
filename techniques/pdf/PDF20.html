   </section><section id="description"><h2>Opis</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this technique is to show how table cells in PDF documents
    				can be marked up so that the logical relationships among rows and columns
    				are preserved and recognized by assistive technology. This is typically
    				accomplished by using a tool for authoring PDF. </p>
      <p>However, tables converted to PDF may have incorrectly merged or split
    				table cells, even if they were marked up correctly in the authoring
    				tool. Authors can ensure that table cells are structured properly by
    				using the Table Editor in Adobe Acrobat Pro's TouchUp Reading Order
    				tool. </p>

         <h3>Repairing table cells using the Table Editor in the TouchUp
    					Reading Order tool in Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro</h3>
         
            <p>This example is shown with Adobe Acrobat Pro. There are other software tools that perform similar functions. See the list of other software tools in <a href="#pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_applications"></a>.</p>
            <p>This example uses a table that was marked up correctly when it was
    						created in Microsoft Word. Some table headers span two rows in the
    						header row; one table header spans two columns. </p>
            <figure id="figure-good-table">
               <img src="img/table-word.jpg" />
                  
                  <figcaption>A correctly marked up table in Word, with complex headers, before conversion to PDF.</figcaption>
                 
            </figure>
            <p>To check the table in the PDF document: </p>
            <ol>
               <li> Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; TouchUp Reading Order... </li>
               <li> Select the table by clicking the number in the top left hand corner 
    						of the table (3 in the reading order in the image below). </li>
               <li> Select the Table Editor button on the TouchUp Reading Order panel.
    						The table cells will be outlined in red and labeled with their tags.
    						The red outlines may not exactly match up to the table cells but
    						you should be able to determine if the cells are tagged correctly. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The following image shows the example table in the TouchUp Reading
    						Order tool. Note that the Results header appears to span two sub-headers
    						and the other headers to the left span the two rows in the Results
    						header. </p>
            <figure id="figure-turo-table">
               <img src="img/table-1.jpg" />
                  
                  <figcaption>Table in the TouchUp Reading Order tool. As in Word, the table Results header appears to span two sub-headers and the other headers to the left span the two rows in the Results header.</figcaption>
                 
            </figure>
            <p>The following images shows the example table in the Table Editor.
    						The cells are outlined in red, and the tab for each cell is displayed.
    						Upon conversion, the Results header was incorrectly split and does
    						not span its two sub-headers. The headers to the right were incorrectly
    						split into 2 cells each and do not span the Results headers. In addition,
    						the incorrectly split cells were merged into one cell. </p>
            <figure id="figure-example-table">
               <img src="img/table-2.jpg" />
                  
                  <figcaption>Example table in the Table Editor, showing table cells and the tag for each cell. The Table Editor shows the Results header was incorrectly split and does not span its two sub-headers; and other headers were also incorrectly split and merged.</figcaption>
                 
            </figure>
            <p>To repair the Results header: </p>
            <ol>
               <li> Select the header in the table (it will be outlined in blue when
    						selected) </li>
               <li> Access the context menu </li>
               <li> Select Table Cell Properties... </li>
               <li> In the Table Cell Properties dialog, change the Column Span from
    							1 to 2 </li>
               <li> Press OK. You'll get a warning that the change might result in
    								a malformed table structure. In this case, the change is correct.
    								The cell you changed should change color to show the new span, as
    								shown in the following image. </li>
            </ol>
            <figure id="figure-table-cells-props">
               <img src="img/table-2a.jpg" />

            </figure>
            <p>Similarly, to repair the incorrectly split header cells to the left
    						of Results header: </p>
            <ol>
               <li> Select the top cell in the column (it will be outlined in blue
    						when selected) </li>
               <li> Access the context menu </li>
               <li> Select Table Cell Properties... </li>
               <li> In the Table Cell Properties dialog, change the Row Span from
    							1 to 2 </li>
               <li> Press OK. The following image shows the correction being made
    								to the last header cell, with the corrected header cells to its left. </li>
            </ol>

            <li>
               <p>For a table that has been repaired with the Table Editor, confirm
    					one of the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li> Read the PDF document with a screen reader, listening to hear
    						that the tabular information is presented in a way that preserves
    						logical relationships among the table header and data cells.
    						(Configure the screen reader to not use heuristics to read table
    						header cells.) </li>
                  <li> Using a PDF editor, verify that the appropriate <em>TR</em>, <em>TH</em>,
    							and <em>TD</em> tags are in the proper reading order and hierarchy
    							in the table tree. </li>
                  <li> Use a tool which is capable of showing the table elements
    								to open the PDF document, view the table structure, and verify
    								that it contains the appropriate TR, TH, and TD structures. </li>
                  <li> Use a tool that exposes the document through the accessibility
    									API, and verify that the table structure contains the appropriate
    									TR, TH, and TD structures, and that they are in the proper reading
    									order and hierarchy. </li>
