            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that the order of content in the source
               code is the same as the visual presentation of the content. The order of content in
               the source code can be changed by the author to any number of visual presentations
               with CSS. Each order may be meaningful in itself but may cause confusion for assistive
               technology users. This could be due to the user switching off the author-specified
               presentation, by accessing the content directly from the source code (such as with
               a screen reader), or by interacting with the content with a keyboard. If a blind user,
               who reads the page with a screen reader that follows the source order, is working
               with a sighted user who reads the page in visual order, they may be confused when
               they encounter information in different orders. A user with low vision who uses a
               screen magnifier in combination with a screen reader may be confused when the reading
               order appears to skip around on the screen. A keyboard user may have trouble predicting
               where focus will go next when the source order does not match the visual order. 
            </p>
            <p>There may also be situations where the visually presented order is necessary to the
               overall understanding of the page, and if the source order is presented differently,
               it may be much more difficult to understand. 
            </p>
            <p>When the source order matches the visual order, everyone will read the content and
               interact with it in the same (correct) order. 
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <div>
                  
                  <p>The <code class="att">tabindex</code> attribute in HTML has two functions. One is to make an element focusable and the
                     other is to assign the element a position in the focus order. A <code class="att">tabindex</code> of 0 makes an element focusable, but adds it to the focus order in the order of source
                     elements. The focus order will follow positive values of tabindex in ascending order.
                     Setting <code class="att">tabindex</code> values that result in an order different from the order of elements in the Document
                     Object Model (DOM) can mean the order is incorrect for users of assistive technologies.
                     This is largely because the tabindex property is specified in the HTML or XHTML and
                     not the CSS. This may change in future specifications. It may also differ from the
                     visual presentation order.
