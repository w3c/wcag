  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Long sets of characters without a space, such as URLs shown as content, can break reflow when the page is zoomed. The objective of this technique is to present URLs without introducing a horizontal scroll bar at a width equivalent to 320 <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> pixels or a vertical scroll bar at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. This is done by using CSS techniques that adapt to the available viewport space. Note: Using a human readable text link, rather than a long URL, is better for usability and accessibility.</p>
  <p>By default most browsers will wrap long URLs at the following characters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;&amp;&quot; Ampersand</li>
    <li>&quot;/&quot; Forward Slash</li>
    <li>&quot;-&quot; Hyphen</li>
    <li>"?" Question Mark</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>Sometimes these are not enough to ensure that long URLs will not overflow the viewport.</p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <section class="example">
    <h3>Breaking long URLs</h3>
    <p>Using the following CSS will cause long URLs to break at appropriate places (hyphens, forward slashes, etc.) and within words without causing reflow.</p>
    <p>List of CSS declarations used and why they are used:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><code class="language-css">overflow-wrap: break-word</code>: Allows words to be broken and wrapped within words. </li>
	    <li><code class="language-css">word-wrap: break-word</code>: Allows words to be broken and wrapped within.</li>
    </ul>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-css">a {
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
  word-wrap: break-word;
}</code></pre>

  <h2>Tests</h2>
  <section class="test-procedure">
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p>For strings of text that are wider than 320px check:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Display the web page in a user agent capable of 400% zoom and set the viewport dimensions (in CSS pixels) to 1280 wide and 1024 high.</li>
      <li>Zoom in by 400%.</li>
      <li>For content read horizontally, check that all content and functionality is available without horizontal scrolling.</li>
      <li>For content read vertically, check that all content and functionality is available without vertical scrolling.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="note">If the browser is not capable of zooming to 400%, you can reduce the width of the browser proportionally. For example, at 300% zoom the viewport should be sized to 960px wide.</p>
