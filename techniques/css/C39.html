  <h2>When to Use</h2>
  <p>
    CSS which causes motion that is triggered by user interactions.

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users to prevent animations (including motion animations) from being displayed on web pages, via the use of the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> CSS Media Query.</p>
  <p>Some users experience distraction or nausea from animated content. For example, if scrolling a page causes elements to move (other than the essential movement associated with scrolling the content, which is under the user's control) it can trigger vestibular disorders.</p>
  <p>Media queries that selectively enable/disable CSS-driven animations based on operating system or user agent preferences allow users to avoid those triggers.</p>
  <p>The understanding document for <a href="../../Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html#resources">Animation from Interactions</a> includes links for changing the 'reduced motion' setting.</p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <section class="example">
    <h3><code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> CSS Media Query</h3>
    <p>Users can indicate their motion preference for interfaces in their system and the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> CSS Media Query will respect that choice. CSS can then be applied to disable that motion for users that request it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* CSS for the motion effect */

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* CSS to disable motion goes here */
}</code></pre>

      <a href="../../working-examples/css-reduced-motion-query/">Working example of 'prefers-reduced-motion' CSS Media Query</a>
    </p>
    <p>Alternatively, it is possible to take the inverse approach: define static styles, and then include a media query that only applies when the user has <em>not</em> set the reduced motion preference.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* "Static" CSS styles */

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  /* CSS for the motion effect goes here */
}</code></pre>

  <h2>Tests</h2>
  <section class="test-procedure">
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p>For each interactive element that triggers a motion animation as a result of a user interaction:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enable the reduced motion setting in your system;</li>
      <li>Check that the motion animation is essential;</li>
      <li>Check that the motion animation is suppressed.</li>
