      <ul id="silverlight.applicability.general">
         <li> Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater </li>
         <li> Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML </li>
      </ul>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to illustrate how in certain cases,
    				the Silverlight automation peer system can provide an accessibility
    				framework <code class="prop">Name</code> based on any simple text strings that
    				are also presented in the visible user interface as control content. </p>
      <p>The applicability of this technique to SC 1.3.1 is that once promoted,
    				the <code class="prop">Name</code> becomes the primary information item that
    				describes the user interface element to accessibiity frameworks and
    				assistive technologies, and the information is thus immune to any further
    				applications of the Silverlight style system that might change the
    				appearance of the visual text equivalent (styled with color, uses italic
    				font for rendering basis, etc.) </p>
      <p>The applicability of this technique to SC 4.1.2 is that the default
    				peer promotion behavior provides the Name component of Name, Role,
    				Value. This is related to the description of the term <em>label</em> in
    				SC4.1.2. </p>
      <p>A default behavior for generating <code class="prop">Name</code> for accessibility
    				frameworks is possible for certain peers of content controls. The content
    				controls that might support a default automation peer behavior include: </p>
      <ul>
         <li> 
               <code class="obj">TextBlock</code> 
            </li>
         <li> 
               <code class="obj">ButtonBase</code> derived classes that do not change
    				the GetNameCore implementation. This includes the <code class="obj">Button</code> class.
    				In order for the default promotion to work, the <code class="prop">Content</code> of
    				the button must be set as a plain string or must contain only a <code class="obj">TextBlock</code>;
    				any compositing such as wrapping in a <code class="obj">Border</code> or
    				other container will disable the default promotion. </li>
         <li> Any other <code class="obj">ContentControl</code> derived class where
    					the <code class="prop">Content</code> property contains either <code class="obj">TextBlock</code> or
    					a text-content-only <code class="obj">ButtonBase</code> implementation as
    					sole content. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In these cases the string that sets either <code class="prop">Content</code> (for <code class="obj">ContentControl</code> and <code class="obj">ButtonBase</code>)
    				or <code class="prop">Text</code> (for <code class="obj">TextBlock</code>) is promoted
    				as the <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> for the control in
    				UI Automation, without any further attribution. The properties in the
    				UI Automation tree are reported to accessibility frameworks (UI Automation,
    				and MSAA through the bridge). The accessibility frameworks reports
    				this information to assistive technology clients. </p>
      <p>Relying on default automation peer behavior is the preferred Silverlight
    				technique for supplying the accessibility framework "Name"   information,
    				so long as the default peer promotion actually does produce a usable
    				name. Using default behavior is preferred because re-using the strings
    				that are already used in the general visual presentation is less likely
    				to result in accessibility-specific strings being forgotten by the
    				application author, or get decoupled from visible UI in a revision
    				process. </p>
      <p>For cases where there is control compositing in a control rather than
    				simple text, the automation peer typically cannot provide a default
    				simple string, and it may be the application author's responsibility
    				to set <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> explicitly as an
    				attribute in XAML, or as a property in runtime code. For details, see <a href="#SL30"></a>. </p>

         <h4> Test-based methodology </h4>
         <p>In order to use this technique effectively, application authors are
    					expected to be following a test-based methodology towards verifying
    					what information their application is reporting to any pertinent accessibility
    					framework. Useful tools for this purpose include SilverlightSpy and
    					UIAVerify. Application authors might examine their running Silverlight
    					application on a test machine where the accessibility framework test
    					viewers are also active. Initially, the application author might view
    					the application at a point in the application development cycle that
    					is prior to any effort devoted to specifically adding accessibility-related
    					information to the application. Silverlight applications might be in
    					this state because the initial user interface design was done in a
    					visually oriented design tool such as Microsoft Expression Blend. Using
    					the test-based methodology, application authors might note that certain
    					accessibility framework properties are already populated, as a result
    					of the mechanisms that are described in this technique. However, it
    					is rare that ALL of the necessary accessibility information for an
    					application can be obtained entirely from the built-in default behaviors
    					of the automation peers. At this point, the application author may
    					have to apply additional Silverlight techniques that provide accessibility
    					framework information, for example <a href="#SL30"></a>. </p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Button is composed with direct text content only</h3>
         
            <p>The following example shows XAML UI only. Logic is not shown, but
    						would typically be added by referencing a Click handler
    						from the XAML. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve"> &lt;Button Height="20" Width="200"&gt;Fire photon torpedoes!&lt;/Button&gt;
</pre>
            <p>The following illustration shows the UIAVerify tree view of this
    						simple interface. Note that the internal string "Fire photon
    						torpedoes!"   is being peer-forwarded. This is verified by the
    						Properties view on the right side: the Name property value is "Fire
    						Photon Torpedoes", even though no programmatic Name property
    						or <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> has been applied to
    						that button that would otherwise have supplied an acccessibility
    						framework "Name". </p>
