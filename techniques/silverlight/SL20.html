            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to illustrate how in certain cases,
               				the Silverlight automation peer system can provide an accessibility
               				framework <code class="prop">Name</code> based on any simple text strings that
               				are also presented in the visible user interface as control content. 
            </p>
            <p>The applicability of this technique to SC 1.3.1 is that once promoted,
               				the <code class="prop">Name</code> becomes the primary information item that
               				describes the user interface element to accessibiity frameworks and
               				assistive technologies, and the information is thus immune to any further
               				applications of the Silverlight style system that might change the
               				appearance of the visual text equivalent (styled with color, uses italic
               				font for rendering basis, etc.) 
            </p>
            <p>The applicability of this technique to SC 4.1.2 is that the default
               				peer promotion behavior provides the Name component of Name, Role,
               				Value. This is related to the description of the term <em>label</em> in
               				SC4.1.2. 
            </p>
            <p>A default behavior for generating <code class="prop">Name</code> for accessibility
               				frameworks is possible for certain peers of content controls. The content
               				controls that might support a default automation peer behavior include: 
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li> 
                  <code class="obj">TextBlock</code> 
                  
               </li>
               
               <li> 
                  <code class="obj">ButtonBase</code> derived classes that do not change
                  				the GetNameCore implementation. This includes the <code class="obj">Button</code> class.
                  				In order for the default promotion to work, the <code class="prop">Content</code> of
                  				the button must be set as a plain string or must contain only a <code class="obj">TextBlock</code>;
                  				any compositing such as wrapping in a <code class="obj">Border</code> or
                  				other container will disable the default promotion. 
               </li>
               
               <li> Any other <code class="obj">ContentControl</code> derived class where
                  					the <code class="prop">Content</code> property contains either <code class="obj">TextBlock</code> or
                  					a text-content-only <code class="obj">ButtonBase</code> implementation as
                  					sole content. 
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>In these cases the string that sets either <code class="prop">Content</code> (for <code class="obj">ContentControl</code> and <code class="obj">ButtonBase</code>)
               				or <code class="prop">Text</code> (for <code class="obj">TextBlock</code>) is promoted
               				as the <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> for the control in
               				UI Automation, without any further attribution. The properties in the
               				UI Automation tree are reported to accessibility frameworks (UI Automation,
               				and MSAA through the bridge). The accessibility frameworks reports
               				this information to assistive technology clients. 
            </p>
            <p>Relying on default automation peer behavior is the preferred Silverlight
               				technique for supplying the accessibility framework "Name"   information,
               				so long as the default peer promotion actually does produce a usable
               				name. Using default behavior is preferred because re-using the strings
               				that are already used in the general visual presentation is less likely
               				to result in accessibility-specific strings being forgotten by the
               				application author, or get decoupled from visible UI in a revision
               				process. 
            </p>
            <p>For cases where there is control compositing in a control rather than
               				simple text, the automation peer typically cannot provide a default
               				simple string, and it may be the application author's responsibility
               				to set <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> explicitly as an
               				attribute in XAML, or as a property in runtime code. For details, see <a href="#SL30"></a>. 
            </p>

               <h3> Test-based methodology </h3>
               
               <p>In order to use this technique effectively, application authors are
                  					expected to be following a test-based methodology towards verifying
                  					what information their application is reporting to any pertinent accessibility
                  					framework. Useful tools for this purpose include SilverlightSpy and
                  					UIAVerify. Application authors might examine their running Silverlight
                  					application on a test machine where the accessibility framework test
                  					viewers are also active. Initially, the application author might view
                  					the application at a point in the application development cycle that
                  					is prior to any effort devoted to specifically adding accessibility-related
                  					information to the application. Silverlight applications might be in
                  					this state because the initial user interface design was done in a
                  					visually oriented design tool such as Microsoft Expression Blend. Using
                  					the test-based methodology, application authors might note that certain
                  					accessibility framework properties are already populated, as a result
                  					of the mechanisms that are described in this technique. However, it
                  					is rare that ALL of the necessary accessibility information for an
                  					application can be obtained entirely from the built-in default behaviors
                  					of the automation peers. At this point, the application author may
                  					have to apply additional Silverlight techniques that provide accessibility
                  					framework information, for example <a href="#SL30"></a>.
