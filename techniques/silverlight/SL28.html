            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to use text captioning that comes
               				from a separate text file, synchronize the captions with the media
               				in a Silverlight <code class="obj">MediaElement</code>, and display the captions
               				in Silverlight. 
            </p>
            <p>There are two variations of the general theme of implementing Silverlight
               				media player controls to work with external timed text: using built-in
               				capabilities of the Microsoft Expression Encoder tool, and using parsing
               				code that consumes caption as a raw file format and converts that format
               				into the Silverlight API's <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> representation.
               				This technique primarily addresses how to use the Expression Encoder
               				technique, along with media player templates that are also provided
               				by Expression Encoder or related Silverlight SDKs such as the Smooth
               				Streaming SDK. 
            </p>
            <p>At a pure architecture level, Silverlight uses the <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> API
               				to display caption text at synchronized times. The Expression Encoder
               				and Expression Blend tools provide a front end to drive the <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> API
               				for the supported formats. The intention of the architecture is so
               				that Silverlight as a run-time has a base architecture that could potentially
               				use any existing or future timed text format, but the tools for Silverlight
               				(rather than built-in features of the runtime) provide the optimized
               				workflow for producing captioned media projects. 
            </p>
            <p>A procedure for using the Expression Encoder and Expression Blend
               				tools to produce a Silverlight media player application that can consume
               				timed text in TTML format is provided as Example 1 in this technique.
               				(Note: prior to the approval of TTML by W3C, DFXP was a format that
               				used much of the eventual TTML vocabulary. In tools that predate TTML,
               				this format is often identified as DFXP.) 
            </p>
            <p>A purely code-based parsing technique, with the goal of avoiding Expression
               				Encoder dependencies, is necessarily more complex. This is because
               				there are multiple issues to solve:

               <li> Parsing the format into general information items like timings,
                  				text, format etc. that are either consumable directly in a Silverlight

               </li>

               <li> Finding a place to store the additional formatting that is conveyed,

               <h3> Text Captioning Formats </h3>
               
               <p>There are several existing text-based formats that are used for text
                  					captioning of prerecorded media. The following are supported as formats
                  					if using the Expression Encoder tool as shown in Example 1 (where the
                  					Expression Encoder generated Silverlight application uses the existing
                  					Silverlight MediaPlayerTemplate and the TimedTextLibrary component.)

               <p>The following are not supported directly in Expression Encoder templates.
                  					To use these formats, application authors would have to write parsing

                  <li> In addition to these formats, other formats for device-specific
                     							recorded media (such as DVD encoded tracks) could be cross-purposed

               </ul>
               
               <p>Rather than build the parsing logic for all these formats into the
                  					Silverlight runtime, or choosing just one of these formats to support,
                  					the Silverlight design for text captioning at the core level instead
                  					makes the <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> property of a <code class="obj">MediaElement</code> writeable,
                  					independently of the value of <code class="prop">Source</code>. The format of
                  					each <code class="obj">TimelineMarker</code> in the collection is very simple:
                  					a time value expressed in the format, and the text value of the text
                  					for that synchronized caption. The time format for <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> is
                  					documented as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.timelinemarker.time%28VS.95%29.aspx">TimelineMarker
                     						reference on MSDN</a>. Converting timed text formats to <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> form
                  					as consumed by the Silverlight core can be done by following any of
                  					the following application design patterns: 
               </p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li> Authoring the project using Expression Encoder, and using the
                     					Expression MediaPlayerTemplate as the media player UI. In this case,
                     					Expression produces a Silverlight application that includes assemblies
                     					that are generated from code templates. The default build of the
                     					project provides a working library that handles all tasks related
                     					to timed-text format conversion, from the formats as documented at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff723862%28Expression.40%29.aspx">About
                        						Captioning (Expression documentation on MSDN)</a>. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> The templates of an Expression Encoder project can also be edited,
                     							either editing the XAML for the UI by altering the template, or by
                     							altering the C# code files that define various aspects of the media
                     							player logic, including the timed text format parsers. Then the project
                     							can be rebuilt using the desired customizations. Using this technique,
                     							it is possible to adapt the code to support timed text formats that
                     							are not directly supported in the Expression Encoder project UI. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Using a 3rd party media player implementation that also includes
                     								a codebase for processing timed text formats, producing <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code>,
                     								and displaying the captions in the player-specific UI. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Including a library that handles just the format parsing, and
                     									using APIs of this library as part of the Silverlight application
                     									code-behind.

                  <li> Writing all logic that is necessary for timed text parsing AND
                     										application UI display, and including it all in the main Silverlight
                     										application library.

               <h3>Example 1: Using Expression Encoder and Expression Blend to produce
                  					a Silverlight media player project from tool output and templates
               </h3>
               <p>By far the simplest technique for incorporating existing timed-text
                  						information is to use Microsoft Expression Encoder and the media player
                  						templates that an Expression Encoder project produces by default. You
                  						can use timed text in any of the following formats: DFXP, SAMI, SRT,
                  						SUB, and LRC. Associating a caption file with a media source is done
                  						as an "import" operation in the Expression Encoder tool.
                  						However, the   "import" does not necessarily mean that the
                  						timed text file is integrated into the media stream; Silverlight authors have
                  the option
                  						to preserve the file separation. This is useful if the application is obtaining
                  						timed text from a third party source in real-time, or if Silverlight authors
                  have a
                  						production pipeline that makes it difficult to have the captioning
                  						ready in time to be encoded in the stream along with the audio-visual
                  						source files. For third-party timed text files that are served directly
                  						from the third party's HTTP servers, it can be useful to supply a dummy
                  						URL in the initial project encoding. The output of the Expression Encoder
                  						project parameterizes many of the project settings at the HTML level.
                  						This makes it possible to change the URL at any time prior to deployment
                  						without having to rebuild the project. The following code is the HTML
                  						output of a sample Expression Encoder project. Note the CaptionSources
                  						node in the initparams; that is the information item that informs the
                  						Expression Encoder templates where to find the timed text file.

                  						from the formatting paradigm of the source (typically HTML/CSS) into

               <p>The following is a brief description of the procedure for creating
                  						a project that incorporates a separate timed text file. 
               </p>
               <ol>
                  
                  <li> From the initial Expression Encoder screen, select New Project
                     						from the File menu. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> In the <em>Load a new project</em> dialog, select <em>Silverlight
                        							Project</em>. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> From the File menu, select Import. Choose the primary media source
                     								file the project will use. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> In the Text tab, find the listing for the media source file. Click
                     									the <em>+</em> icon to the right of the file name. This opens
                     									a file dialog. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Choose a timed text file to add to the project. </li>
                  
                  <li> Build the project. By default the project produces a complete
                     										output folder. The folder includes the media player template XAP,
                     										the timed text file as a separate file, and additional libraries
                     										and XAPs that support the basic template and/or the timed text capabilities.
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Optionally, use the features in the Templates tab of Expression
                     											Encoder to generate a template copy. You can edit the template copy
                     											in other tools such as Expression Blend or Visual Studio, to change
                     											the layout or behavior from the default media player template. Template
                     											editing can address requirements such as applying a particular branding
                     											or "look" to the player user interface. 
                  </li>
                  
               </ol>

                  						tabs of an Expression user interface are dockable; the orientations
                  						shown here are the default, but could be in different locations on

               <h3>Example 2: Code parses timed text; MediaElement handles MarkerReached,
                  				displays marker text in application-defined TextBox
               </h3>
               <p>This example defines a very simple media player class that includes
                  						a display surface, basic controls, and a text display for captions
                  						as part of its default template. The usage code for this control in
                  						XAML is simple, but only because the majority of the implementation
                  						is present in the definition of the media player class. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  					The following is example usage XAML: 
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve"> &lt;local:SimpleMediaPlayerWithTT Width="480" Height="360" CaptionUri="testttml.xml" MediaSourceUri="/xbox.wmv" /&gt;
    					</pre><p>Note the attributes CaptionUri and SimpleMediaPlayerWithTT. Each
                  						of these is a custom property of the media control class TTReader.
                  						CaptionUri in particular references a URL, in this case a local URL
                  						from the same server that serves the Silverlight XAP. The timed text
                  						file could come from a different server also, but comes from a local
                  						server in this example to conform to the behavior of the test file. 
               </p>
               <p>The following is the generic.xaml default template for the media player
                  						control. The template is mainly relevant for showing the named elements
                  						that are shown in the initialization code.
