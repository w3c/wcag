      <ul id="silverlight.applicability.general">
         <li> Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater </li>
         <li> Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML </li>
      </ul>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to use text captioning that comes
    				from a separate text file, synchronize the captions with the media
    				in a Silverlight <code class="obj">MediaElement</code>, and display the captions
    				in Silverlight. </p>
      <p>There are two variations of the general theme of implementing Silverlight
    				media player controls to work with external timed text: using built-in
    				capabilities of the Microsoft Expression Encoder tool, and using parsing
    				code that consumes caption as a raw file format and converts that format
    				into the Silverlight API's <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> representation.
    				This technique primarily addresses how to use the Expression Encoder
    				technique, along with media player templates that are also provided
    				by Expression Encoder or related Silverlight SDKs such as the Smooth
    				Streaming SDK. </p>
      <p>At a pure architecture level, Silverlight uses the <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> API
    				to display caption text at synchronized times. The Expression Encoder
    				and Expression Blend tools provide a front end to drive the <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> API
    				for the supported formats. The intention of the architecture is so
    				that Silverlight as a run-time has a base architecture that could potentially
    				use any existing or future timed text format, but the tools for Silverlight
    				(rather than built-in features of the runtime) provide the optimized
    				workflow for producing captioned media projects. </p>
      <p>A procedure for using the Expression Encoder and Expression Blend
    				tools to produce a Silverlight media player application that can consume
    				timed text in TTML format is provided as Example 1 in this technique.
    				(Note: prior to the approval of TTML by W3C, DFXP was a format that
    				used much of the eventual TTML vocabulary. In tools that predate TTML,
    				this format is often identified as DFXP.) </p>
      <p>A purely code-based parsing technique, with the goal of avoiding Expression
    				Encoder dependencies, is necessarily more complex. This is because
    				there are multiple issues to solve: </p>
      <ul>
         <li> Obtaining and validating the timed text file </li>
         <li> Parsing the format into general information items like timings,
    				text, format etc. that are either consumable directly in a Silverlight
    				API, or useful as intermediates </li>
         <li> Using the timecode information to create <code class="obj">TimelineMarker</code> representations
    					for each timed text entity </li>
         <li> Associating the <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> with media loaded
    						by the player </li>
         <li> Finding a place to store the additional formatting that is conveyed,
    							including the text and any formatting </li>
         <li> Handling events from <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> in the media
    								player, in such a way that text and formatting behavior can be retrieved
    								and presented in the Text part of the player UI </li>
      </ul>

         <h4> Text Captioning Formats </h4>
         <p>There are several existing text-based formats that are used for text
    					captioning of prerecorded media. The following are supported as formats
    					if using the Expression Encoder tool as shown in Example 1 (where the
    					Expression Encoder generated Silverlight application uses the existing
    					Silverlight MediaPlayerTemplate and the TimedTextLibrary component.)
    					For more information on which timed text formats can be referenced
    					in an Expression Encoder project, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff723862%28Expression.40%29.aspx">About
    						Captioning (Expression documentation on MSDN)</a>. </p>
         <ul>
            <li> SAMI (Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange). For more information
    					on this format, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms971327.aspx">Understanding
    						SAMI 1.0</a> on MSDN. </li>
            <li> SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language). For more
    							information on this format, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-SMIL3-20081201/">Synchronized
    								Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 3.0)</a> on W3C site. </li>
            <li> TT (Timed Text) in particular TTML (Timed Text Markup Language).
    									For more information, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/">Timed
    										Text Markup Language (TTML) 1.0</a> on W3C site. </li>
         </ul>
         <p>The following are not supported directly in Expression Encoder templates.
    					To use these formats, application authors would have to write parsing
    					logic, as shown in Example 2: </p>
         <ul>
            <li> MPEG Part 17 / 3GPP Timed Text. For more information, see <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39478">ISO/IEC
    					14496-17:2006</a> on ISO site. </li>
            <li> Other formats that have not realized wide adoption, for example
    						Universal Subtitle Format. </li>
            <li> In addition to these formats, other formats for device-specific
    							recorded media (such as DVD encoded tracks) could be cross-purposed
    							for use by streaming/online media. </li>
         </ul>
         <p>Rather than build the parsing logic for all these formats into the
    					Silverlight runtime, or choosing just one of these formats to support,
    					the Silverlight design for text captioning at the core level instead
    					makes the <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> property of a <code class="obj">MediaElement</code> writeable,
    					independently of the value of <code class="prop">Source</code>. The format of
    					each <code class="obj">TimelineMarker</code> in the collection is very simple:
    					a time value expressed in the format, and the text value of the text
    					for that synchronized caption. The time format for <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> is
    					documented as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.timelinemarker.time%28VS.95%29.aspx">TimelineMarker
    						reference on MSDN</a>. Converting timed text formats to <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> form
    					as consumed by the Silverlight core can be done by following any of
    					the following application design patterns: </p>
         <ul>
            <li> Authoring the project using Expression Encoder, and using the
    					Expression MediaPlayerTemplate as the media player UI. In this case,
    					Expression produces a Silverlight application that includes assemblies
    					that are generated from code templates. The default build of the
    					project provides a working library that handles all tasks related
    					to timed-text format conversion, from the formats as documented at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff723862%28Expression.40%29.aspx">About
    						Captioning (Expression documentation on MSDN)</a>. </li>
            <li> The templates of an Expression Encoder project can also be edited,
    							either editing the XAML for the UI by altering the template, or by
    							altering the C# code files that define various aspects of the media
    							player logic, including the timed text format parsers. Then the project
    							can be rebuilt using the desired customizations. Using this technique,
    							it is possible to adapt the code to support timed text formats that
    							are not directly supported in the Expression Encoder project UI. </li>
            <li> Using a 3rd party media player implementation that also includes
    								a codebase for processing timed text formats, producing <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code>,
    								and displaying the captions in the player-specific UI. </li>
            <li> Including a library that handles just the format parsing, and
    									using APIs of this library as part of the Silverlight application
    									code-behind. </li>
            <li> Writing all logic that is necessary for timed text parsing AND
    										application UI display, and including it all in the main Silverlight
    										application library. </li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Using Expression Encoder and Expression Blend to produce
    					a Silverlight media player project from tool output and templates</h3>
         
            <p>By far the simplest technique for incorporating existing timed-text
    						information is to use Microsoft Expression Encoder and the media player
    						templates that an Expression Encoder project produces by default. You
    						can use timed text in any of the following formats: DFXP, SAMI, SRT,
    						SUB, and LRC. Associating a caption file with a media source is done
    						as an "import" operation in the Expression Encoder tool.
    						However, the   "import" does not necessarily mean that the
    						timed text file is integrated into the media stream; Silverlight authors have the option
    						to preserve the file separation. This is useful if the application is obtaining
    						timed text from a third party source in real-time, or if Silverlight authors have a
    						production pipeline that makes it difficult to have the captioning
    						ready in time to be encoded in the stream along with the audio-visual
    						source files. For third-party timed text files that are served directly
    						from the third party's HTTP servers, it can be useful to supply a dummy
    						URL in the initial project encoding. The output of the Expression Encoder
    						project parameterizes many of the project settings at the HTML level.
    						This makes it possible to change the URL at any time prior to deployment
    						without having to rebuild the project. The following code is the HTML
    						output of a sample Expression Encoder project. Note the CaptionSources
    						node in the initparams; that is the information item that informs the
    						Expression Encoder templates where to find the timed text file. </p>

            <p>The templates include a library that handles any parsing requirements
    						for the chosen timed text format, both at the level of getting the
    						basic text and timing into the <code class="obj">TimelineMarkers</code> used
    						by the run-time <code class="obj">MediaElement</code>, and for preserving
    						a subset of format information that can reasonably be crossmapped
    						from the formatting paradigm of the source (typically HTML/CSS) into
    						the Silverlight text object model of the text element that displays
    						the captions in the running Silverlight application. </p>
            <p>The following is a brief description of the procedure for creating
    						a project that incorporates a separate timed text file. </p>
            <ol>
               <li> From the initial Expression Encoder screen, select New Project
    						from the File menu. </li>
               <li> In the <em>Load a new project</em> dialog, select <em>Silverlight
    							Project</em>. </li>
               <li> From the File menu, select Import. Choose the primary media source
    								file the project will use. </li>
               <li> In the Text tab, find the listing for the media source file. Click
    									the <em>+</em> icon to the right of the file name. This opens
    									a file dialog. </li>
               <li> Choose a timed text file to add to the project. </li>
               <li> Build the project. By default the project produces a complete
    										output folder. The folder includes the media player template XAP,
    										the timed text file as a separate file, and additional libraries
    										and XAPs that support the basic template and/or the timed text capabilities. </li>
               <li> Optionally, use the features in the Templates tab of Expression
    											Encoder to generate a template copy. You can edit the template copy
    											in other tools such as Expression Blend or Visual Studio, to change
    											the layout or behavior from the default media player template. Template
    											editing can address requirements such as applying a particular branding
    											or "look" to the player user interface. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The following is a screenshot of the Expression Encoder (version 4)
    						interface. The <em>+</em> icon mentioned in Step 4 is highlighted
    						in this screenshot with a red diamond. The <em>Templates</em> tab
    						mentioned in Step 7 is on the right side, top-middle. Note that all
    						tabs of an Expression user interface are dockable; the orientations
    						shown here are the default, but could be in different locations on
    						any given computer or configuration. </p>

            <p>This example defines a very simple media player class that includes
    						a display surface, basic controls, and a text display for captions
    						as part of its default template. The usage code for this control in

            <p>Note the attributes CaptionUri and SimpleMediaPlayerWithTT. Each
    						of these is a custom property of the media control class TTReader.

            <p>The following is the logic that is particular to obtaining the separate
    						caption file. Some of this logic is referenced in the preceding template-specific
    						event handlers. This example uses the asynchronous <code class="obj">WebClient</code> technique
    						to request the file result of the <code class="prop">CaptionUri</code>. Make
    						sure to use <code class="prop">AutoPlay</code>=false or some other means to allow
    						time for the caption file to download before attempting to play the
    						media file. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">       private void LoadCaptions(Uri captionURL)
       {
           WebClient wc = new WebClient();   // Web Client to download data files
           if (captionURL != null)
           {
               wc.DownloadStringCompleted +=
                   new DownloadStringCompletedEventHandler(OnDownloadStringCompleted);
               wc.DownloadStringAsync(captionURL);
           }
       }
       private void OnDownloadStringCompleted(object sender, DownloadStringCompletedEventArgs e)
       {
           if (!e.Cancelled &amp;&amp; e.Error == null &amp;&amp; e.Result != "")
           {
               string xml = e.Result.Trim();
               ParseCaptionData(new StringReader(xml));
           }
       }
       </pre>
            <p>The actual parsing can be done using a combination of the "XML
    						to Linq" facilities of an optional Silverlight library, and
    						standard .NET Framework string format APIs from the Silverlight core.
    						An implementation is NOT provided here, due to length considerations.
    						TTML supports a number of profiles and capabilities. The basic pattern
    						to follow in the implementation is to obtain the necessary text and
    						timing information, and to pass it to a function that might resemble
    						the following code template. This code template takes the raw information,
    						generates a new <code class="obj">TimelineMarker</code>, and adds it to the
    						collection assigned to the active <code class="obj">MediaElement</code> as
    						identified by "player" in the application. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">       public void AddMediaMarker(string time, string type, string data)
       {
           TimelineMarker marker = new TimelineMarker();
           marker.Time = new TimeSpan(0,0,(Convert.ToInt32(time.Trim())/1000));
           // this logic could vary depending on how time is formatted in the input string; this one assumes raw milliseconds
           marker.Type = type;
           marker.Text = data.Trim();
           player.Markers.Add(marker);
       }
