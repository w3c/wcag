      <ul id="silverlight.applicability.general">
         <li> Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater </li>
         <li> Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML </li>
      </ul>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to show how to access an alternate
    				audio channel in a prepared media file that is played in a Silverlight <code class="obj">MediaElement</code>. </p>
      <p>Silverlight supports media file formats that contains additional audio
    				channels in synchronization, beyond the two tracks for stereo audio
    				that are used by typical media player defaults. Silverlight provides
    				a dedicated <code class="prop">AudioStreamIndex</code> API on <code class="obj">MediaElement</code>,
    				so that the Silverlight application author can use Silverlight programming
    				techniques to select which audio channel to play for the user. Silverlight
    				control authors might label a UI control with text such as "Activate
    				this button to listen to an audio-only version of the media presentation" so
    				that the purpose of the media element control interface is clear to
    				the user. That way the same media control can be used to present the
    				media either as audio-video or as audio-only with alternate track depending
    				on user preference at run time. </p>
      <p>The media formats that are supported by Silverlight are documented
    				on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189080(VS.95).aspx">MSDN</a>. </p>
   	<section id="SL1_media_encoding">
         <h4>Media encoding</h4>
         <p>The process of encoding the media with additional audio channels is
    					not described in this technique because configuring and encoding audio
    					channels for media formats is a technique for any usage of media in
    					a computer application, not just a Silverlight-specific technique or
    					a Web technology technique. For more information on one possible procedure
    					for encoding the media in WMV format, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=321498">Microsoft Expression Encoder Overview</a>.
    					Often, Silverlight authors will receive the media from a third party,
    					such as a video production facility, and are not directly involved
    					with the encoding process. Silverlight authors should verify that the
    					media they are using has alternate audio tracks encoded in it. If such
    					tracks exist, Silverlight authors will need a track listing from the
    					media producer to know which of the audio tracks is intended as the
    					alternate audio. Other tracks might exist in the encoded media that
    					provide language translations of the default audio, or that serve other
    					purposes. </p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Changing AudioStreamIndex </h3>
         
            <p>This example has a UI definition in XAML and interaction logic in
    						C#. In addition to the typical Play/Pause/Stop controls, this interface
    						includes a Play Full-Description Audio button. Activating the button
    						invokes a function that swaps the audio channels and plays an alternative
    						synchronized audio channel that contains a composite full-description audio track. </p>
            <p>The following is the basic UI in XAML. This example is deliberately
    						simple and does not include <code class="obj">AutomationProperties</code>.
    						Audio streams are identified by an index in a collection. </p>
