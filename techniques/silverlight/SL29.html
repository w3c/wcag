            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to use some of the basic user interface
               				objects in Silveright to produce blocks of content that are identified
               				as a "List" to accessibility frameworks and to Silverlight's
               				own tab sequence navigation behavior. 
            </p>
            <p>Using the "List" technique results in a tab sequence behavior
               				whereby that element is treated as a single tab stop, even if that
               				element has consituent elements (the list items) that would otherwise
               				be considered additional tab stops in the main tab sequence. In the
               				default key handling, when the user presses the TAB key while focus
               				is on a List, the focus goes to the next element after the List. To
               				focus the items of the list, the user would press the Arrow keys rather
               				than TAB. In the Silverlight programming model for controls, this tab
               				sequence behavior is expressed by the <code class="prop">TabNavigation</code> property
               				holding the value of <code class="prop">Once</code>. The Silverlight <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</a> is
               				a control that reports itself as "List" role, and that has
               				a default <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.tabnavigation%28VS.95%29.aspx">TabNavigation.Once</a> value.
               				Thus <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</a> as
               				per this technique is a lightweight technique for producing blocks
               				that can be bypassed. It is specifically a lightweight technique because
               				it can be accomplished by writing simple application-level XAML and
               				using only the Silverlight core libraries. 
            </p>
            <p>Silverlight also supports more full-featured techniques for producing
               				bypass blocks that are based on common user interface features such
               				as menus or toolbars. However, using toolbars in Silverlight is inherently
               				not as lightweight because the Silverlight core libraries themselves
               				do not include a ready-made toolbar. Silverlight provides a <code class="obj">ContextMenu</code> as
               				part of the Silverlight Toolkit extensions, but the behavior of this
               				particular menu does not easily address the bypass block scenario.
               				Silverlight includes all the infrastructure and necessary base classes
               				for defining a toolbar or a menu that could address the bypass block
               				scenario. Many third-party control implementations of menus and toolbars
               				exist, either as part of control packages that are sold by control
               				vendors, or through community mechanisms such as CodePlex or third-party
               				sites that provide free source code. For some examples, see the following:

               </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>If application authors use a built-in control such as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</a> where
               				the accessibility framework reported role is not traditionally associated
               				with a navigation role, it is a best practice to set <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> such
               				that the name informs the user of the purpose of the list control.
               				Otherwise, the role alone leaves this ambiguous. For example, an author
               				might name the list control "Navigation control". 
            </p>
            <p>Often the List control itself is focusable. So long as the List control
               				has a visual focus indicator, that behavior might be acceptable. However,
               				it might provide a better user experience to deliberately have the
               				List itself non-focusable, and instead have focus fall to the first
               				List item when focus reaches that region. Otherwise, the List might
               				be perceived as an "extra" tab stop to some users. To enable
               				that behavior, set <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.istabstop%28VS.95%29.aspx">IsTabStop</a> to
               				false on the List control. The List itself still provides the intended
               				tab navigation behavior, and is still reported and identified to accessibility
               				frameworks and assistive technologies, even when the List container
               				is not focusable. This is shown in Example 1, by setting <code class="prop">IsTabStop</code> as
               				part of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.style%28VS.95%29.aspx">Style</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>When an accessibility framework presents a List, assistive technologies
               				are generally expected to continue to support use of the same key behavior
               				as the default behavior, and to report to users that the item is a
               				List when it is focused. If assistive technologies use the accessibility
               				framework APIs for navigation, the items in the list are considered
               				child elements. Navigating either by spatial direction (e.g. NAVDIR_RIGHT
               				in MSAA) or sequential direction (e.g. NAVDIR_NEXT in MSAA) skips the
               				list items and goes to the spatial/next peer.

               <h3>Example 1: Customize the behavior and appearance of a ListBox to
                  					construct a navigation control that can be bypassed
               </h3>
               <p>In this example, several properties that influence the items presentation
                  						behavior of the Silverlight core control <code class="obj">ListBox</code> are
                  						adjusted to make it suitable for a navigation control. The behavior
                  						of this control is that when the tab sequence reaches the control,   "next"
                  or
                  						spatial navigation continues on to other controls, rather than through
                  						the child controls of the list's items/options. This is enabled and
                  						properly reported because <code class="obj">ListBox</code> reports its accessibility
                  						framework role as "List", uses <code class="prop">TabNavigation</code> = Once as
                  						default (because it is the default, <code class="prop">TabNavigation</code> does not have to
                  						be set explicitly in the markup). <code class="obj">ListBox</code> has default
                  						key handling for the arrow keys (to enable traversing the choices in
                  						the menu by keyboard-only). The control could also be visually a menu
                  						or perhaps other user interface control metaphors, depending on how
                  						it is visually templated and composited. Regardless of appearance,
                  						the accessibility framework and any assistive technologies based on
                  						that framework will treat the control as a "List". This example
                  						is templated as a horizontally oriented toolbar-type control. The items
                  						in this example are <code class="obj">Button</code> controls, but could be
                  						templated to not appear quite as button-like, or could instead use
                  						another focusable control for the items such as a read-only <code class="obj">TextBox</code>.

                  <li> Using a browser that supports Silverlight, open an HTML page that
                     					references a Silverlight application through an object tag. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Press TAB key to traverse typical tab sequence within the Silverlight
                     						application. Verify that common areas in the user interface composition
                     						("blocks") that are reporting the List role per this technique
                     						can be bypassed without having to tab through each constituent part
                     						(the "items/children" of the List). 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Verify that the list children are still accessible by keyboard,
                     							by using ARROW keys rather than TAB. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Engage an accessibility framework test tool such as UIAVerify.
                     								Examine roles in the automation tree, and verify that the List used
                     								for bypass behavior reports a combination of name+role that is consistent
                     								with the behavior.
