      <ul id="silverlight.applicability.general">
         <li> Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater </li>
         <li> Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML </li>
      </ul>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to use some of the basic user interface
    				objects in Silveright to produce blocks of content that are identified
    				as a "List" to accessibility frameworks and to Silverlight's
    				own tab sequence navigation behavior. </p>
      <p>Using the "List" technique results in a tab sequence behavior
    				whereby that element is treated as a single tab stop, even if that
    				element has consituent elements (the list items) that would otherwise
    				be considered additional tab stops in the main tab sequence. In the
    				default key handling, when the user presses the TAB key while focus
    				is on a List, the focus goes to the next element after the List. To
    				focus the items of the list, the user would press the Arrow keys rather
    				than TAB. In the Silverlight programming model for controls, this tab
    				sequence behavior is expressed by the <code class="prop">TabNavigation</code> property
    				holding the value of <code class="prop">Once</code>. The Silverlight <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</a> is
    				a control that reports itself as "List" role, and that has
    				a default <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.tabnavigation%28VS.95%29.aspx">TabNavigation.Once</a> value.
    				Thus <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</a> as
    				per this technique is a lightweight technique for producing blocks
    				that can be bypassed. It is specifically a lightweight technique because
    				it can be accomplished by writing simple application-level XAML and
    				using only the Silverlight core libraries. </p>
      <p>Silverlight also supports more full-featured techniques for producing
    				bypass blocks that are based on common user interface features such
    				as menus or toolbars. However, using toolbars in Silverlight is inherently
    				not as lightweight because the Silverlight core libraries themselves
    				do not include a ready-made toolbar. Silverlight provides a <code class="obj">ContextMenu</code> as
    				part of the Silverlight Toolkit extensions, but the behavior of this
    				particular menu does not easily address the bypass block scenario.
    				Silverlight includes all the infrastructure and necessary base classes
    				for defining a toolbar or a menu that could address the bypass block
    				scenario. Many third-party control implementations of menus and toolbars
    				exist, either as part of control packages that are sold by control
    				vendors, or through community mechanisms such as CodePlex or third-party
    				sites that provide free source code. For some examples, see the following: </p>

            </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If application authors use a built-in control such as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox%28VS.95%29.aspx">ListBox</a> where
    				the accessibility framework reported role is not traditionally associated
    				with a navigation role, it is a best practice to set <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> such
    				that the name informs the user of the purpose of the list control.
    				Otherwise, the role alone leaves this ambiguous. For example, an author
    				might name the list control "Navigation control". </p>
      <p>Often the List control itself is focusable. So long as the List control
    				has a visual focus indicator, that behavior might be acceptable. However,
    				it might provide a better user experience to deliberately have the
    				List itself non-focusable, and instead have focus fall to the first
    				List item when focus reaches that region. Otherwise, the List might
    				be perceived as an "extra" tab stop to some users. To enable
    				that behavior, set <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.istabstop%28VS.95%29.aspx">IsTabStop</a> to
    				false on the List control. The List itself still provides the intended
    				tab navigation behavior, and is still reported and identified to accessibility
    				frameworks and assistive technologies, even when the List container
    				is not focusable. This is shown in Example 1, by setting <code class="prop">IsTabStop</code> as
    				part of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.style%28VS.95%29.aspx">Style</a>. </p>
      <p>When an accessibility framework presents a List, assistive technologies
    				are generally expected to continue to support use of the same key behavior
    				as the default behavior, and to report to users that the item is a
    				List when it is focused. If assistive technologies use the accessibility
    				framework APIs for navigation, the items in the list are considered
    				child elements. Navigating either by spatial direction (e.g. NAVDIR_RIGHT
    				in MSAA) or sequential direction (e.g. NAVDIR_NEXT in MSAA) skips the
    				list items and goes to the spatial/next peer. </p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Customize the behavior and appearance of a ListBox to
    					construct a navigation control that can be bypassed</h3>
         
            <p>In this example, several properties that influence the items presentation
    						behavior of the Silverlight core control <code class="obj">ListBox</code> are
    						adjusted to make it suitable for a navigation control. The behavior
    						of this control is that when the tab sequence reaches the control,   "next" or
    						spatial navigation continues on to other controls, rather than through
    						the child controls of the list's items/options. This is enabled and
    						properly reported because <code class="obj">ListBox</code> reports its accessibility
    						framework role as "List", uses <code class="prop">TabNavigation</code> = Once as
    						default (because it is the default, <code class="prop">TabNavigation</code> does not have to
    						be set explicitly in the markup). <code class="obj">ListBox</code> has default
    						key handling for the arrow keys (to enable traversing the choices in
    						the menu by keyboard-only). The control could also be visually a menu
    						or perhaps other user interface control metaphors, depending on how
    						it is visually templated and composited. Regardless of appearance,
    						the accessibility framework and any assistive technologies based on
    						that framework will treat the control as a "List". This example
    						is templated as a horizontally oriented toolbar-type control. The items
    						in this example are <code class="obj">Button</code> controls, but could be
    						templated to not appear quite as button-like, or could instead use
    						another focusable control for the items such as a read-only <code class="obj">TextBox</code>. </p>

            <li> Using a browser that supports Silverlight, open an HTML page that
    					references a Silverlight application through an object tag. </li>
            <li> Press TAB key to traverse typical tab sequence within the Silverlight
    						application. Verify that common areas in the user interface composition
    						("blocks") that are reporting the List role per this technique
    						can be bypassed without having to tab through each constituent part
    						(the "items/children" of the List). </li>
            <li> Verify that the list children are still accessible by keyboard,
    							by using ARROW keys rather than TAB. </li>
            <li> Engage an accessibility framework test tool such as UIAVerify.
    								Examine roles in the automation tree, and verify that the List used
    								for bypass behavior reports a combination of name+role that is consistent
    								with the behavior. </li>
            <li> Use a screen reader to verify that name and role are reported
    									properly. </li>
