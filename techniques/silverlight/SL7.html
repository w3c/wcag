            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to build custom visual states for
               				custom controls that include visible focus indicators in the templates
               				and parts. 
            </p>
            <p>The default Silverlight core controls all indicate some type of visible
               				focus indication, through their default templates. For more information
               				on how Silverlight controls will generally supply a default visual
               				focus indicator, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc903954(VS.95).aspx">Focus
                  					Overview on MSDN</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>Silverlight control skinning is enabled through a deliberate separation
               				of visible user interface design and control logic in the Silverlight
               				control model. Control authors expect that application authors might
               				reskin their control. But control authors should provide an initial
               				default set of states, templates, etc. so that application authors
               				have a good baseline of functionality to compare with their customization.
               				Defining visible focus states for all control parts is an example of
               				such baseline functionality. In order to make the visual focus state
               				customizable, the visual state should be associated with a name. Ideally
               				that name should have a human-readable meaning that hints at its purpose,
               				but the real reason for the name is that it connects the XAML-defined
               				template (which control consumers can change) with the control logic
               				defined by the control author (which control consumers cannot change).
               				Also, the visual names and groups in the XAML should be attributed
               				on the control class, to assist design tools. The best resource for
               				general information about Silverlight control customization is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278064%28v=VS.95%29.aspx">Silverlight

               <h3>Component Parts</h3>
               
               <p>Some controls are created by assembling various component parts that
                  					are already defined as controls either by the Silverlight run time
                  					libraries or by third parties. That scenario is not really what this
                  					technique is about, because in that case the focus behavior is already
                  					defined by the component's template, and the control author can re-use
                  					that behavior as-is or reskin it but still through the same named state
                  					definition. This technique specifically addresses how to define a control
                  					where the interactive surface has mouse and keyboard handling defined
                  					at a lower level for the control as a whole. The actual focus region
                  					is defined by the control author in that case, and the focus indicator
                  					is also defined to match the behavior visually and functionally.

               <h3>Design for Focus Indicators</h3>
               
               <p>The general design principles for visual focus indicators are that
                  					the indicators should apply a visual change to the focus region's exterior
                  					margin. A common pattern is to deliberately define the visuals for
                  					the control with a pre-existing blank margin for its layout slot; that
                  					way when the focus indicator is applied, the focus indicator can fill
                  					that margin. 
               </p>
               
               <p>The actual graphic for the visual focus indicator is typically a border
                  					or shaped frame of a solid color brush with at least 1 pixel line thickness.
                  					The color used for the border stands out visually from the underlying
                  					control background or other elements of the control. The contrast between
                  					brush for visual focus and the remainder of control should be a contrast
                  					difference that is visible to users who do not distinguish the hue
                  					of colors, but can distinguish the lightness/value. In many cases the
                  					border is rectangular, to go along with the control's layout slot.
                  					However, if the control's basic shape is a non-rectangular shape, sometimes
                  					the focus indicator is designed to make a border around that shape.
                  					An example of a default Silverlight control that is round and applies
                  					an exterior round border as a focus indicator is a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.radiobutton%28VS.95%29.aspx">RadioButton</a>. 
               </p>
               
               <p>Most focus indicator designs change only the border and do not change
                  					the main area of the control. One reason for this is that changes to
                  					the main control are typically reserved for other interactive states
                  					that also have a visual indicator. Specifically, controls need a visual
                  					state that indicates that the mouse is over the control (this is termed
                  					either MouseOver or Hover state). Controls that support activation
                  					also have a visual state that provides feedback for activation. For
                  					example, the default Silverlight <code class="obj">RepeatButton</code> changes
                  					its <code class="prop">Background</code> gradient on the button field to be
                  					darker blue value when the mouse is over the button, and changes to
                  					an even darker value blue when the button is activated (either by clicking
                  					the mouse or by pressing SPACE or ENTER with keyboard focus on the <code class="obj">RepeatButton</code>).
                  					To see this behavior in a live sample, see <a href="http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/Silverlight/SampleBrowser/index.htm#/?sref=System.Windows.Controls.RepeatButtonEx">RepeatButton
                     						sample on MSDN</a>.

               <h3>Logic for Focus Indicators</h3>
               
               <p>Typical logic is that the border to indicate focus is present in the
                  					default template design, but with an initial value of Visibility=Collapsed.
                  					Then, a visual state for focus is defined with a name that properly
                  					indicates its purpose as text (example: "Focused"). In addition,
                  					a state is needed that undoes whatever changes were applied for focus,
                  					once focus moves to another element (for example,   "Unfocused").
                  					For example, if the "Focused" state sets the value Visibility=Visible
                  					on some element, the "Unfocused" state sets that value to
                  					Collapsed again. Silverlight's visual state system also provides a
                  					way to group related states with a factoring name (for example, "FocusStates").
                  					For more information on state names and state groups in Silverlight
                  					visual states, as well as learning how these states define a control
                  					contract that any control consumers should follow if they reskin that
                  					control, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189093(VS.95).aspx">Customizing
                     						the Appearance of an Existing Control by Using a ControlTemplate on
                     						MSDN</a>. 
               </p>
               
               <p>The visual state system is designed to support visual transitions
                  					to states, and for that reason the visual state system is closely coupled
                  					with the Silverlight animation system. By animating the transition,
                  					the visual appearance changes over a time interval. Typically, if transitions
                  					are used, the time interval is short, one second or less. In the case
                  					of focus indicators, it is typical to not use transitions and to instead
                  					make a discrete change; otherwise, the state change might be interpreted
                  					by users as a lag in interface response from their system. 
               </p>
               
               <p>The states themselves are designed in XAML, but are loaded and unloaded
                  					through logic that the control author defines as part of their control
                  					code. The control author does this by handling the appropriate events
                  					that occur while the event scope applies to their control. For example,
                  					to apply the "Focused" state, the control author handles
                  					the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.uielement.gotfocus%28VS.95%29.aspx">GotFocus
                     						event</a>. Rather than handle the event directly, the more common pattern
                  					is to override a virtual method that acts as a prewired event handler, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.ongotfocus%28v=VS.95%29.aspx">OnGotFocus</a>.
                  					The centralized logic for visual state changes is the method <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd991369%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">GoToState</a>,
                  					with one of the parameters to pass representing the XAML name of the
                  					correct state to load from the XAML templates. Examples for all of
                  					the APIs discussed here are available in the MSDN topic <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278064(VS.95).aspx">Creating
                     						a New Control by Creating a ControlTemplate</a>.

               <h3>Focus in Silverlight</h3>
               
               <p>Focus in Silverlight is equivalent to the larger user interface and
                  					application concept of keyboard focus. The element that has focus is
                  					the element within the Silverlight object tree and programming model
                  					that has first chance to process the Silverlight key events. As a more
                  					tangible example that is user-centric, if a <code class="obj">TextBox</code> has
                  					keyboard focus, then when the user presses keys on the keyboard, the
                  					characters associated with the user's pressed keys (or possibly input
                  					that is enabled by an assistive technology that can substitute for
                  					key strokes) will appear in the <code class="obj">TextBox</code>. A user interface
                  					element in Silverlight can obtain keyboard focus in one of three ways: 
               </p>
               
               <ol>
                  
                  <li> The user uses the Silverlight tab sequence to traverse into the
                     					Silverlight content and to focus a specific control. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> The Silverlight application's logic calls the Focus() method programmatically
                     						to force focus to a control. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> The user performs some other action, for example uses the mouse
                     							to click on a control. That control's specific logic handles the
                     							Silverlight input event and uses that event as stimulus to call Focus()
                     							on that control. The difference between this case and the above case
                     							is that the behavior is typically built-in to that control's runtime
                     							behavior, and does not require each application author to call Focus()
                     							in application code. 
                  </li>

                  						In this particular example, "Unfocused" is a state without
                  						a definition. Switching to the definitionless state has the effect
                  						of reverting to the default state, which in the case of this design
                  						is intentional. Alternatively, authors could make specific template
                  						changes that revert any animation that applied to the focused state.
