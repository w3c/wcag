      <p>The objective of this technique is to build custom visual states for
    				custom controls that include visible focus indicators in the templates
    				and parts. </p>
      <p>The default Silverlight core controls all indicate some type of visible
    				focus indication, through their default templates. For more information
    				on how Silverlight controls will generally supply a default visual
    				focus indicator, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc903954(VS.95).aspx">Focus
    					Overview on MSDN</a>. </p>
      <p>Silverlight control skinning is enabled through a deliberate separation
    				of visible user interface design and control logic in the Silverlight
    				control model. Control authors expect that application authors might
    				reskin their control. But control authors should provide an initial
    				default set of states, templates, etc. so that application authors
    				have a good baseline of functionality to compare with their customization.
    				Defining visible focus states for all control parts is an example of
    				such baseline functionality. In order to make the visual focus state
    				customizable, the visual state should be associated with a name. Ideally
    				that name should have a human-readable meaning that hints at its purpose,
    				but the real reason for the name is that it connects the XAML-defined
    				template (which control consumers can change) with the control logic
    				defined by the control author (which control consumers cannot change).
    				Also, the visual names and groups in the XAML should be attributed
    				on the control class, to assist design tools. The best resource for
    				general information about Silverlight control customization is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278064%28v=VS.95%29.aspx">Silverlight
    					documentation on MSDN</a>. </p>
   	<section id="SL7_component_parts">
         <h4>Component Parts</h4>
         <p>Some controls are created by assembling various component parts that
    					are already defined as controls either by the Silverlight run time
    					libraries or by third parties. That scenario is not really what this
    					technique is about, because in that case the focus behavior is already
    					defined by the component's template, and the control author can re-use
    					that behavior as-is or reskin it but still through the same named state
    					definition. This technique specifically addresses how to define a control
    					where the interactive surface has mouse and keyboard handling defined
    					at a lower level for the control as a whole. The actual focus region
    					is defined by the control author in that case, and the focus indicator
    					is also defined to match the behavior visually and functionally. </p>
   	</section>
   	<section id="SL7_focus_indicator_design">
         <h4>Design for Focus Indicators</h4>
         <p>The general design principles for visual focus indicators are that
    					the indicators should apply a visual change to the focus region's exterior
    					margin. A common pattern is to deliberately define the visuals for
    					the control with a pre-existing blank margin for its layout slot; that
    					way when the focus indicator is applied, the focus indicator can fill
    					that margin. </p>
         <p>The actual graphic for the visual focus indicator is typically a border
    					or shaped frame of a solid color brush with at least 1 pixel line thickness.
    					The color used for the border stands out visually from the underlying
    					control background or other elements of the control. The contrast between
    					brush for visual focus and the remainder of control should be a contrast
    					difference that is visible to users who do not distinguish the hue
    					of colors, but can distinguish the lightness/value. In many cases the
    					border is rectangular, to go along with the control's layout slot.
    					However, if the control's basic shape is a non-rectangular shape, sometimes
    					the focus indicator is designed to make a border around that shape.
    					An example of a default Silverlight control that is round and applies
    					an exterior round border as a focus indicator is a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.radiobutton%28VS.95%29.aspx">RadioButton</a>. </p>
         <p>Most focus indicator designs change only the border and do not change
    					the main area of the control. One reason for this is that changes to
    					the main control are typically reserved for other interactive states
    					that also have a visual indicator. Specifically, controls need a visual
    					state that indicates that the mouse is over the control (this is termed
    					either MouseOver or Hover state). Controls that support activation
    					also have a visual state that provides feedback for activation. For
    					example, the default Silverlight <code class="obj">RepeatButton</code> changes
    					its <code class="prop">Background</code> gradient on the button field to be
    					darker blue value when the mouse is over the button, and changes to
    					an even darker value blue when the button is activated (either by clicking
    					the mouse or by pressing SPACE or ENTER with keyboard focus on the <code class="obj">RepeatButton</code>).
    					To see this behavior in a live sample, see <a href="http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/Silverlight/SampleBrowser/index.htm#/?sref=System.Windows.Controls.RepeatButtonEx">RepeatButton
    						sample on MSDN</a>. </p>

   	<section id="SL7_focus_indicator_logic">
         <h4>Logic for Focus Indicators</h4>
         <p>Typical logic is that the border to indicate focus is present in the
    					default template design, but with an initial value of Visibility=Collapsed.
    					Then, a visual state for focus is defined with a name that properly
    					indicates its purpose as text (example: "Focused"). In addition,
    					a state is needed that undoes whatever changes were applied for focus,
    					once focus moves to another element (for example,   "Unfocused").
    					For example, if the "Focused" state sets the value Visibility=Visible
    					on some element, the "Unfocused" state sets that value to
    					Collapsed again. Silverlight's visual state system also provides a
    					way to group related states with a factoring name (for example, "FocusStates").
    					For more information on state names and state groups in Silverlight
    					visual states, as well as learning how these states define a control
    					contract that any control consumers should follow if they reskin that
    					control, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189093(VS.95).aspx">Customizing
    						the Appearance of an Existing Control by Using a ControlTemplate on
    						MSDN</a>. </p>
         <p>The visual state system is designed to support visual transitions
    					to states, and for that reason the visual state system is closely coupled
    					with the Silverlight animation system. By animating the transition,
    					the visual appearance changes over a time interval. Typically, if transitions
    					are used, the time interval is short, one second or less. In the case
    					of focus indicators, it is typical to not use transitions and to instead
    					make a discrete change; otherwise, the state change might be interpreted
    					by users as a lag in interface response from their system. </p>
         <p>The states themselves are designed in XAML, but are loaded and unloaded
    					through logic that the control author defines as part of their control
    					code. The control author does this by handling the appropriate events
    					that occur while the event scope applies to their control. For example,
    					to apply the "Focused" state, the control author handles
    					the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.uielement.gotfocus%28VS.95%29.aspx">GotFocus
    						event</a>. Rather than handle the event directly, the more common pattern
    					is to override a virtual method that acts as a prewired event handler, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.ongotfocus%28v=VS.95%29.aspx">OnGotFocus</a>.
    					The centralized logic for visual state changes is the method <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd991369%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">GoToState</a>,
    					with one of the parameters to pass representing the XAML name of the
    					correct state to load from the XAML templates. Examples for all of
    					the APIs discussed here are available in the MSDN topic <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278064(VS.95).aspx">Creating
    						a New Control by Creating a ControlTemplate</a>. </p>

         <h4>Focus in Silverlight</h4>
         <p>Focus in Silverlight is equivalent to the larger user interface and
    					application concept of keyboard focus. The element that has focus is
    					the element within the Silverlight object tree and programming model
    					that has first chance to process the Silverlight key events. As a more
    					tangible example that is user-centric, if a <code class="obj">TextBox</code> has
    					keyboard focus, then when the user presses keys on the keyboard, the
    					characters associated with the user's pressed keys (or possibly input
    					that is enabled by an assistive technology that can substitute for
    					key strokes) will appear in the <code class="obj">TextBox</code>. A user interface
    					element in Silverlight can obtain keyboard focus in one of three ways: </p>
         <ol>
            <li> The user uses the Silverlight tab sequence to traverse into the
    					Silverlight content and to focus a specific control. </li>
            <li> The Silverlight application's logic calls the Focus() method programmatically
    						to force focus to a control. </li>
            <li> The user performs some other action, for example uses the mouse
    							to click on a control. That control's specific logic handles the
    							Silverlight input event and uses that event as stimulus to call Focus()
    							on that control. The difference between this case and the above case
    							is that the behavior is typically built-in to that control's runtime
    							behavior, and does not require each application author to call Focus()
    							in application code. </li>
         </ol>
