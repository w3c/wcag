      <ul id="silverlight.applicability.general">
         <li> Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater </li>
         <li> Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML </li>
      </ul>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to handle key events in a Silverlight
    				application and enable application-specific keyboard functionality
    				in a Silverlight application. The keyboard functionality might relate
    				to a particular element of the Silverlight application user interface,
    				or might be a handler for global key events within the application,
    				such as an application-wide access key. </p>
      <p>In Silverlight, application authors handle user input by attaching
    				event handlers for input events. The input events are implemented on
    				a class that is a base element in the Silverlight class hierarchy,
    				such that all Silverlight UI elements can be the source of an input
    				event if the user interacts with them. Typically, the event handler
    				names are specified in XAML, although it is also possible to wire events
    				in code. The implementation of the handlers for the Silverlight managed
    				code programming model is always done in C# or Visual Basic code. </p>
      <p>The most commonly used input events are the following: </p>
      <ul>
         <li> 
               KeyUp, KeyDown - these are the
    				key events. Which key is pressed is determined by event parameters
    				passed to the handler. </li>
         <li> 
               MouseEnter, MouseOver, MouseLeave 
            </li>
         <li> 
               MouseLeftButtonDown, MouseLeftButtonUp, MouseRightButtonDown, MouseRightButtonUp 
            </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other forms of input that Silverlight supports include touch devices
    				(with mouse promotion for cases where the application runs on devices
    				that do not have touch input modes) and a related inking mode. For
    				any UI interaction that uses mouse input or these other input modes,
    				Silverlight application authors can write a parallel key event handler
    				to provide users the keyboard equivalent. </p>
      <p>Also, the Silverlight event system and control model combine to enable
    				behavior whereby a mouse event and a keyboard event can be treated
    				as the same event and can be handled by a common event handler. Using
    				this technique, Silverlight authors can facilitate keyboard functionality
    				in custom controls or as override behavior to existing Silverlight-supplied
    				controls, and provide equivalence for mouse events or events that are
    				specific to other input devices. Silverlight authors can also use controls
    				that already have a keyboard equivalence as a built-in behavior. </p>
      <p>The parallel key event handler case, and the built-in behavior case,
    				are each shown in one of the examples. </p>
      <p>All input events report a specific source that is communicated to
    				handler code as an event parameter, so that the application author
    				can identify which element in their Silverlight UI was being interacted
    				with, and the application can perform an action that is relevant to
    				that user input. In the case of mouse events, the event source is the
    				element that the mouse pointer is over at the time. In the case of
    				key events, the event source is the element that has focus. The element
    				that has focus is visually indicated so that the user knows which element
    				they are interacting with (see <a href="#SL2"></a>). Assistive technologies
    				often have parallel conventions whereby the user is made aware of which
    				element is visually focused and is the current input scope presented
    				by the assistive technology, </p>

         <h4>Browser hosts and keyboard events</h4>
         <p>Silverlight is hosted as a plug-in inside a browser host. The Silverlight
    					run-time only receives the input events that the browser host forwards
    					to hosted plug-ins through a browser-specific program access layer.
    					Occasionally the browser host receives input that the browser host
    					itself handles in some way, and does not forward the keyboard event.
    					An example is that a Silverlight application hosted by an Internet
    					Explorer browser host on Windows operating system cannot detect a press
    					of the ALT key, because Internet Explorer processes this input and
    					performs the action of bringing keyboard focus to the Internet Explorer
    					menu bar. Silverlight authors might need to be aware of browser-specific
    					input handling models and not rely on key events for keys that are
    					essentially reserved for use by a browser host. For more information,
    					see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189015(VS.95).aspx">Keyboard

         <h4>Other event models</h4>
         <p>This technique specifically discusses event handling for the Silverlight
    					managed programming model. However, Silverlight also supports parallel
    					models for event handling, either through a Silverlight run-time feature
    					or due to Silverlight's role as a plug-in within a script-capable browser
    					host. For example, events from the HTML DOM can be handled by JavaScript
    					at HTML scope for the overall Silverlight plug-in; this uses the browser
    					host as script processor and the Silverlight run-time is not directly
    					involved. Or, HTML DOM events can be handled through an HTML bridge
    					that calls into Silverlight application code. These event models can
    					potentially be used to provide keyboard equivalence, but it is generally
    					more convenient to use the managed code model as described in this
    					technique. For more information on other event models in Silverlight,
    					see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189018(VS.95).aspx">Events

   </section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>Two examples are given. The first example is for the scenario of a
    				Silverlight application author that is simply incorporating an existing
    				control into their application design, and is taking advantage of mouse-keyboard
    				equivalence that is already defined by certain Silverlight core controls.
    				The second example is from the perspective of a control author, or
    				at least that of a Silverlight application author that intends to encapsulate
    				behavior in a custom Silverlight control and use it in their own application.
    				For this second example, the control will handle the general Silverlight
    				input event KeyUp, in order to check for input from
    				key(s) that are designated to have a specific input meaning for that
    				control. </p>
      <section class="example">
         <h3>Built-in keyboard equivalence for core Silverlight controls</h3>
         
            <p>This example pertains to cases where the control that handles key
    						events is focusable (through the tab sequence, etc.) and where an existing
    						Silverlight control behavior provides the keyboard equivalence In this
    						example, a Silverlight UI includes a <code class="obj">Button</code> element.
    						For sighted users, or users that generally use the mouse to interact
    						with UI, a typical way to interact with the button is to position the
    						mouse pointer over the element, and click the left mouse button. However,
    						the <code class="obj">Button</code> also supports a built-in key handling behavior,
    						whereby either the SPACE or ENTER keys are treated as an equivalent
    						action to clicking the button with a mouse. The requirement for this
    						interaction is that the <code class="obj">Button</code> must have keyboard
    						focus at the point in time that SPACE or ENTER are pressed. The <code class="obj">Button</code> might
    						gain focus because the user pressed the TAB key to move through the
    						tab sequence, or some equivalent action enabled by assistive technology.
    						In terms of the programming experience, the Silverlight application
    						author does not have to separately handle KeyDown for
    						this case. Within the <code class="obj">Button</code> control built-in code,
    						the special case of SPACE or ENTER keys pressed while a <code class="obj">Button</code> has
    						focus invokes the button’s Click event. Then the Silverlight
    						application author can simply handle Click without
    						differentiating whether the input action was a mouse click or a keyboard
    						equivalent. The following is the entire XAML UI. </p>

         <h3>Keyboard events for a custom control, keyboard equivalence</h3>
         
            <p>In this example, a new Silverlight custom control named SimpleNumericUpDown
    						uses a control template that includes two buttons. To provide keyboard
    						equivalence for the buttons, an event handler is defined by the control
    						class code. The event handler invokes the action in response to certain
    						accelerator keys, where these actions are equivalent to clicking the
    						button composition parts of the control with a mouse. The following
    						is the default XAML template. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;ControlTemplate TargetType="local:SimpleNumericUpDown"&gt;
  &lt;Border Background="{TemplateBinding Background}"
          BorderBrush="{TemplateBinding BorderBrush}"
          BorderThickness="{TemplateBinding BorderThickness}" Name="controlFrame"&gt;
      &lt;Grid&gt;
          &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
              &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*"/&gt;
              &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="30"/&gt;
          &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
          &lt;TextBox x:Name="valueBox" Text="{Binding NumericValue, RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}}"/&gt;
          &lt;StackPanel Grid.Column="1"&gt;

            <p>The following C# code shows the event handlers. Also, the code includes
