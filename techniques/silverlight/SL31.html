      <ul id="silverlight.applicability.general">
         <li> Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater </li>
         <li> Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML </li>

      <p>The objective of this technique is to change the presentation / visual
    				appearance of text, by setting several of the font-specific properties
    				in the Silverlight API. Changing such properties does not change the
    				semantic meaning of the text, nor does it alter the representation
    				of the text that is available to assistive technologies through the
    				Silverlight support of the UIA accessibility framework. By using font
    				properties, it is possible to introduce a wide variety of presentation
    				changes to fonts that do not introduce semantic elements that interfere
    				with an assistive technology's view of text in the Silverlight application.
    				In particular, adjusting font properties will make it possible to avoid
    				any need for use of images of text, yet still provide a wide range
    				of choices for text presentation. </p>
      <p>Silverlight font properties exist on all controls, as well as on other
    				text elements that are not true controls. For controls, the font properties
    				apply in any case where the control enables a presentation mode that
    				has enclosed text areas in its layout. By setting Silverlight font
    				properties, it is possible to adjust presentation of font features
    				without changing the structural connotation of that control, or the
    				value of any control-specific property that contains plain-text. For
    				example, the <code class="prop">FontSize</code> property can be set on a <code class="obj">Paragraph</code> (not
    				a control) or on a <code class="obj">Button</code> (a control, and in this
    				case the font size changes apply to any text displayed in the button
    				content area). Font properties are also inheriting properties, meaning
    				that if applying a font property value to a container in a relationship,
    				those font property values can apply to child elements in the relationship.
    				For example, if a <code class="prop">FontSize</code> is applied to a <code class="obj">RichTextBox</code>,
    				that <code class="prop">FontSize</code> value is used by default by all the <code class="obj">Paragraph</code> items
    				displayed in the <code class="obj">RichTextBox</code>. </p>
      <p>Similar to CSS, Silverlight font properties can be grouped as a <code class="obj">Style</code>.
    				That <code class="obj">Style</code> can be applied to all instances of a text
    				element type (for example to all cases of <code class="obj">Paragraph</code>)
    				or specifically referenced as a resource that is only used by certain
    				instances of a text element type. Either way, the <code class="obj">Style</code> feature
    				enables the separation of presentation from semantics for text elements,
    				and enables workflows where content authors supply the semantic text
    				and design-oriented authors adjust the related Silverlight styles.
    				For more information on the Silverlight concept of styles, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc278068(VS.95).aspx">Control
    					Customization on MSDN</a>. </p>
      <p>The following Silverlight font properties are useful to style text
    				and avoid the need for text in images. Links in this list refer to
    				the <code class="obj">Control</code> class version of these properties. </p>
      <ul>
         <li> The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontfamily%28VS.95%29.aspx">FontFamily</a> property
    				is used to display the code aspect in a monospace font family (specifically,
    				FontFamily="Courier New"). </li>
         <li> The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontsize%28VS.95%29.aspx">FontSize</a> property
    				is used to display the text in a larger size. </li>
         <li> The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontstyle%28VS.95%29.aspx">FontStyle</a> property
    				is used to display text in italics. </li>
         <li> The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontweight(v=vs.110).aspx">FontWeight</a> property
    				is used to set how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed. </li>
         <li> The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontstretch.aspx">FontStretch</a> property
    				is used to control the spacing of letters in text. </li>
         <li> The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.foreground%28VS.95%29.aspx">Foreground</a> property
    				is used to display the color of text or text containers. </li>
         <li> The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.background%28VS.95%29.aspx">Background</a> property
    			can be used to display text on a non-text background. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>So long as images of text are avoided, the text within a Silverlight
    				text element can be reported to the UI Automation accessibility framework
    				that Silverlight supports. That text is reported using the same basic
    				text content as is used for semantic text display in the UI. In other
    				words, exposing that text to assistive technologies that use UIA as
    				a framework does not require the Silverlight application author to
    				resort to automation-specific override properties such as <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.HelpText</code>;
    				the automation peers for text elements report all necessary text content
    				to automation as a built-in behavior of the text element controls.

         <h4> CSS versus Silverlight font properties </h4>
         <p>Related CSS techniques mention that users can override any page-declared
    					CSS styling techniques, by invoking browser-specific features. For
    					example, using Internet Explorer, a user can use Tools / Internet Options,
    					Appearance / Accessibility to override certain classifications of CSS-controlled
    					font properties when displaying HTML documents, or to use a user-specific
    					style sheet for HTML documents. No browser-level equivalent feature
    					exists for user alteration of Silverlight text properties in the Silverlight
    					content area. Instead, application authors could supply controls that
    					enable similar font-property changing behavior, and include those controls
    					in the application-specific user interface. For more information on
    					this technique, see <a href="#SL13"></a>. </p>

   	<section id="SL31_glyphs">
         <h4> Glyphs </h4>
         <p>Silverlight API includes a related text presentation API <code class="obj">Glyphs</code>. <code class="obj">Glyphs</code> is
    					intended for specific decorative or niche language-support scenarios.
    					The <code class="obj">Glyphs</code> API does not offer as much UIA exposure
    					or the ability to programmatically change typical font properties;
    					the main scenarios for <code class="obj">Glyphs</code> are to package migrated
    					text content from document formats, or for purely decorative text in
    					a font that is not commonly found on a user system and only the glyphs
    					actually used in the Unicode string are subsetted into the <code class="obj">Glyphs</code> font
    					payload. If addressing the WCAG criteria, authors should avoid using <code class="obj">Glyphs</code> API
    					and instead use other text containers such as <code class="obj">TextBox</code>,
    					along with a font that is supplied in the application package or known
    					to exist on the end user system. </p>

            <p>This example illustrates applying runtime changes to a font property. </p>
            <p>This example has UI in XAML, and logic in C#. The following is the
    					XAML. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;UserControl x:Class="DocumentStructure.MainPage"

   &lt;StackPanel x:Name="LayoutRoot" Background="White"&gt;
   &lt;RichTextBox IsReadOnly="True" Name="rtb" FontFamily="Algerian" FontSize="20"&gt;
           &lt;Paragraph&gt;Call me Ishmael. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little or no money in my purse, 
           and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little 
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and 
regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever 
it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before 
coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my 
&lt;Hyperlink NavigateUri="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hypo"&gt;hypos&lt;/Hyperlink&gt;
get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into 
the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. 
This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself 
upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, 
almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same 
feelings towards the ocean with me.
           &lt;/Paragraph&gt;
           &lt;Paragraph&gt;There now is your
               &lt;Hyperlink 
               NavigateUri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Harbor"&gt;insular city of the Manhattoes&lt;/Hyperlink&gt;
, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it 
with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the 
battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours 
previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
           &lt;/Paragraph&gt;
           &lt;Paragraph&gt;Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. 
Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?
--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men 
fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; 
some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving 
to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How 
then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?
           &lt;/Paragraph&gt;
       &lt;/RichTextBox&gt;
       &lt;Button Name="swapper" Click="swapper_Click" Width="220"&gt;Swap styles&lt;/Button&gt;
   &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</pre>
            <p>The following is C# code: </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">       private void swapper_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
