      <ul id="silverlight.applicability.general">
         <li> Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater </li>
         <li> Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML </li>

   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to associate a "Pause" or "Stop"   action
    				for a Silverlight animation with a user interface control. This enables
    				a user to pause or stop an animation in Silverlight content. </p>
      <p>The Silverlight animation system is generalized such that nearly any
    				Silverlight property of type <code class="obj">Double</code>, <code class="obj">Point</code> or <code class="obj">Color</code> can
    				be animated, or a property can cycle through discrete object values.
    				Thus the possibilities for which properties in the user interface can
    				be animated are quite broad. The general technique shown can be used
    				to pause or stop any Silverlight animation, including those that are
    				purely decorative. </p>
   	<section id="SL11_pause_stop">
         <h4> Pause versus Stop </h4>
         <p>Silverlight has two discrete methods for animation control: a Pause method
    					and a Stop method. The difference in behavior is that Pause uses
    					whatever the last value was while the animation was still running,
    					and holds that value permanenently (unless the animation is restarted). Stop sets
    					the value to be whatever value existed before the animation was started.
    					However, calling Stop on an animation often results
    					in a behavior that looks like a "reset"   to the user; this
    					is particularly true if the animation is animating an element's position
    					on screen. In many cases, what might be a conceptual   "stop" for
    					the user is better accomplished by a "permanent Pause" in
    					the Silverlight animation API. Whether to call Pause or Stop is
    					an aesthetic decision and application authors can experiment to see
    					which behavior has the best appearance. If application authors choose
    					to use Stop, authors can simply replace the call to
    					.Pause() with a call to .Stop() for any code that is based on this
    					technique's example. </p>

         <h3>Pausing a decorative animation</h3>
         
            <p>The following is the XAML UI. The animated object and the animation
    						behavior are both described in XAML, as is the control that users can
    						activate to pause the animation. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;UserControl x:Class="PauseBouncyBall.MainPage"

   &lt;Storyboard x:Key="anim" RepeatBehavior="Forever" &gt;
       &lt;DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetName="Ball"

            <p>The following is the C# logic. One function is the "page"   constructor,
    						which is what starts and loops the animation. The other function
    						is the event handler for the UI control (a button). The event handler
    						retrieves the animation definition from the page resources, and calls
    						the Pause method on the animation. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">       public MainPage()
       {
           InitializeComponent();
           (this.Resources["anim"] as Storyboard).Begin();
       }
       private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
       {
           (this.Resources["anim"] as Storyboard).Pause();

         <ol>
            <li> Using a browser that supports Silverlight, open an HTML page that
    					references a Silverlight application through an object tag. For Silverlight
    					content with moving, blinking, scrolling or auto-updating content
    					that is the result of a running Silverlight animation: </li>
            <li> Check for a mechanism to stop the movement, blinking, scrolling
    						or auto-updating. </li>
            <li> Check that the movement, blinking, scrolling or auto-updating
    							stops when the mechanism is activated and does not restart by itself. </li>
            <li> For pause, check that the animation can be restarted using a start
    								mechanism. </li>
