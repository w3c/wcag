      <p use-id="silverlight.applicability.general"></p>
   </section><section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to use text captioning that is
    				embedded in the stream with media displayed in a Silverlight MediaElement,
    				and present that text captioning in a separate Silverlight control
    				or text element. </p>
      <p>This particular technique uses scripting files with a TimelineMarkers collection
    				that are embedded directly within the media file. When text captioning
    				is embedded directly in the streams, synchonization of the scripting
    				stream versus the video content stream is done automatically by the MediaElement component.
    				Each time the MarkerReached event fires, that is an
    				indication that a synch point in the video that corresponds to a script
    				marker entry has been reached. Silverlight application authors can
    				obtain the text from the relevant timeline marker entry through their
    				event handler implementations, and can display captions in the user
    				interface area where the text captions are displayed. Typical Silverlight
    				controls that can be used for displaying text captions include TextBlock (nonfocusable), TextBox,
    				or RichTextBox. A typical interface design would place
    				the caption-display control in close proximity to the MediaElement control
    				that is being captioned, for example might place the captions directly
    				underneath the MediaElement "screen". </p>
      <p>Script-embedded captions are captions that are stored directly in
    				the media file as metadata, rather than as a separate file. For information
    				about techniques for captions in separate files, see <a href="#SL28"></a>. </p>
      
         <h> Tools </h>
         <p>Producing the media file with TimelineMarkers captions
    					directly in embedded scripting can be accomplished using the Microsoft
    					Expression Encoder tool. Online help for the procedure of encoding
    					scripting with text captions in the stream are available in the offline
    					Help file that installs with the Microsoft Expression 4 Encoder products.
    					For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=321498">Expression
    						Encoder Pro Overview</a>.</p>
         <p>There is a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd743937%28VS.85%29.aspx">public
    					API</a> for introducing Markers into a WMV file, as part of the Windows
    					Media Format SDK. Using Expression Encoder is the way that the task
    					of directly embedding TimelineMarkers is presented
    					and taught in Microsoft's available instructional material on Silverlight.
    					However, because the mechanism is public, it is possible that other
    					tools exist or will exist that can also produce media with script-encoded TimelineMarkers. </p>

         <h3>Example 1: MediaElement handles MarkerReached, displays marker text
    					in existing TextBox</h3>
         <section class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This example has a UI definition in XAML and interaction logic in
    						C#. The following is the basic UI in XAML. This example is deliberately
    						simple and does not include AutomationProperties for
    						identification or user instructions. The most relevant part of this
    						example is that the Silverlight author declares a handler for the event MarkerReached.
    						This event fires potentially hundreds of times, once for each caption
    						in the stream. Each time the event fires, the event handler runs and
    						adds the text to the dedicated TextBox in the user
    						interface. </p>

            <li> Using a browser that supports Silverlight, open an HTML page that
    					references a Silverlight application through an object tag. The application
    					plays media that is expected to have text captioning. </li>
            <li> Check that a text area in the user interface shows captions for
    						the media. </li>
