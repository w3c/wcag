            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to use the characteristics of the
               				XAML language to support basic parsing requirements that both applications
               				and accessibility frameworks rely upon. This technique explains the
               				role of XAML in the overall Silverlight development and application
               				architecture, in particular for defining the elements that make up
               				a Silverlight user interface. This technique also present some basic
               				facts about XAML as a language; more information of this nature is
               				also included in <a href="#silverlight_notes"></a>. 
            </p>
            <p>XAML is a markup language for object instantiation. XAML can be incorporated
               				into a technology such as Silverlight. A specific XAML vocabulary can
               				be defined by a technology such as Silverlight, and the vocabulary
               				can be extended by anyone that provides suitable backing code. For
               				example, a Silverlight application author can define a custom class,
               				and the application author or potentially other Silverlight application
               				authors can use XAML to instantiate instances of the custom class. 
            </p>
            <p>XAML has a <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114525">published
                  				language specification</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>XAML does not necessarily declare the entirety of the object tree
               				that a Silverlight client runtime loads, but XAML typically declares
               				the majority of the objects/elements that represent the Silverlight
               				application's user interface. The objects and values that are used
               				for accessibility scenarios are often closely related to the standard
               				user interface, and thus accessibility-related properties are typically
               				declared in XAML rather than in code, even though setting the values
               				in code is technically possible.

               <h3> XAML and XML </h3>
               
               <p>XAML is based on XML, and shares many of its language features. Some
                  					of the language features that are directly relevant to the stated intent
                  					of SC4.1.1 and to 4.1.1 related techniques include: 
               </p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li> Well-formedness: The definition of well-formed XAML is the same
                     					as the XML definition. XAML processors, including the Silverlight
                     					runtime XAML parser, will block loading XAML that is not well formed. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Duplicate attributes: Unless specially configured for scenarios
                     						such as design-time support, XAML processors will block loading XAML
                     						where elements contain duplicate attributes. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Quote matching: mismatched quote matching for attribute values
                     							in XAML constitutes XAML that is not well formed. 
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               <p>Some XAML language features that are analogous to XML but have some
                  					technology-specific differences include: 
               </p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li> Identifiers: XAML defines a <code class="prop">Name</code> directive, which
                     					is analogous to <code class="att">xml:id</code> in that <code class="prop">Name</code> serves
                     					as the unique identifier of an element. However, XAML defines an
                     					additional concept of a XAML namescope, which permits a XAML document
                     					to contain multiple XAML namescopes as a factoring technique. Thus,
                     					identical <code class="prop">Name</code> values are permitted in a XAML document
                     					so long as each is defined in a separate XAML namescope. XAML namescopes
                     					are associated with elements, such that the extent of each XAML namescope
                     					is understood by XAML processors. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Schemas and vocabularies: A notable difference between XAML and
                     						XML is that a XAML vocabulary is not typically represented in existing
                     						XML schema definition formats such as XSD or DTD. XAML includes inheritance
                     						and reference features that cannot adequately be expressed in XSD
                     						or other existing XML schema representation formats. This affects
                     						the "elements are nested according to their specifications"   consideration
                     						of SC4.1.1. XAML definitely has the ability to enforce nesting restrictions
                     						as represented by a XAML vocabulary. However, XAML validity for a
                     						vocabulary is deliberately fluid, in order to support extension by
                     						user code. XAML validity is determined by a combination of a XAML
                     						processor, a XAML concept known as a XAML schema context, and the
                     						code that backs the XAML and defines any objects being instantiated
                     						as a parsing result. Typically, design time tools such as Microsoft
                     						Visual Studio can adequately duplicate the runtime validity characteristics
                     						of a XAML vocabulary. Using these tools, application authors can
                     						both verify XAML validity as well as receive design-time information
                     						for how to correct any XAML validity errors. 
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>

               <h3> XAML parsing and HTML parsing </h3>
               
               <p>In the Silverlight implementation, XAML is like HTML in that it is
                  					loaded and parsed just-in-time. Silverlight XAML is not precompiled
                  					to binary or MSIL (the language-neutral CLR runtime format). Instead,Silverlight
                  					XAML is transmitted or stored as plain text, either loose or packaged
                  					as resources in a library. Thus Silverlight XAML is human readable
                  					as well as machine readable. 
               </p>
               
               <p>However, unlike HTML, Silverlight XAML is only intended to be loaded
                  					and interpreted by the Silverlight runtime, rather than multiple possible
                  					user agents that each implement an HTML engine. HTML is a language
                  					where the behavior is also specified. In contrast, XAML is a language
                  					for referencing constructs that are defined in runtime libraries, and
                  					the functional specification of the XAML language itself is minimal
                  					(intrinsics; language rules; primitive types). Layout, appearance,
                  					type-member sets, roles, etc. are all left up to specific frameworks
                  					and vocabularies that use XAML. Behavior associated with a given XAML
                  					construct is based on type definitions made in a runtime library. For
                  					Silverlight XAML, the types are from Silverlight core libraries, but
                  					often the definitions come from libraries that are available to the
                  					Silverlight runtime as part of an application's packaging for distribution. 
               </p>
               
               <p>XAML is generally speaking strict, and will raise parsing errors if
                  					XAML contains elements that are not recognized. Such parsing errors
                  					generally present the information in the XAML from resulting in any
                  					objects being created, which in turn prevents a Silverlight application
                  					from running. This is different from typical (non-xHTML) HTML, where
                  					implementations are permitted to contain nonrecognized elements or
                  					attributes and ignore them.

                  <p>Silverlight XAML is able to be loaded by design tools for Silverlight.
                     							In the design tool, the XAML is interpreted much like the runtime interprets
                     							it, in order to show the visual representation of the Silverlight application.
                     							In addition, the design tool might implement design surfaces in which
                     							the user interface can be changed, and typically provides a way to
                     							save any changes made in the tool back into the loaded XAML. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>At design time, tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio or Microsoft
                     							Expression might provide opportunities to correct any XAML errors before
                     							the Silverlight application is compiled and packaged for deployment.
                     							This might be implemented by performing static analysis of the XAML,
                     							by forwarding the design tool's own parser errors as it renders the
                     							design surface, or by forwarding linking errors that are identified
                     							by a precompile step (for example, missing event handlers raise a XAML
                     							error from precompile). This behavior is sometimes identified as a <em>design
                        								mode</em> behavior in Microsoft documentation and other documentation
                     							about Visual Studio or specific tools. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Regardless of how a given XAML file behaves while being interacted
                     							with in a design mode, it is the Silverlight runtime XAML parser on
                     							each client installation that is the ultimate determinant of whether
                     							the XAML is valid or invalid.

                  <p>Note that it is common that an error message is displayed to users
                     					in HTML, which is implemented by handling the JavaScript OnError event
                     					emitted by the Silverlight plugin. XAML parse errors are forwarded
                     					to JavaScript errors and can be handled in this way. However, it is
                     					also possible that the application is production-ready, and deliberately
                     					does not expose any JavaScript errors, whether Silverlight managed
                     					code errors or not. If seeing the specific error is important, the
                     					test might need to be run against a preproduction or debug version
                     					of the application.
