      <p>The objective of this technique is to use the characteristics of the
    				XAML language to support basic parsing requirements that both applications
    				and accessibility frameworks rely upon. This technique explains the
    				role of XAML in the overall Silverlight development and application
    				architecture, in particular for defining the elements that make up
    				a Silverlight user interface. This technique also present some basic
    				facts about XAML as a language; more information of this nature is
    				also included in <a href="#silverlight_notes"></a>. </p>
      <p>XAML is a markup language for object instantiation. XAML can be incorporated
    				into a technology such as Silverlight. A specific XAML vocabulary can
    				be defined by a technology such as Silverlight, and the vocabulary
    				can be extended by anyone that provides suitable backing code. For
    				example, a Silverlight application author can define a custom class,
    				and the application author or potentially other Silverlight application
    				authors can use XAML to instantiate instances of the custom class. </p>
      <p>XAML has a <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114525">published
    				language specification</a>. </p>
      <p>XAML does not necessarily declare the entirety of the object tree
    				that a Silverlight client runtime loads, but XAML typically declares
    				the majority of the objects/elements that represent the Silverlight
    				application's user interface. The objects and values that are used
    				for accessibility scenarios are often closely related to the standard
    				user interface, and thus accessibility-related properties are typically
    				declared in XAML rather than in code, even though setting the values
    				in code is technically possible. </p>

         <h4> XAML and XML </h4>
         <p>XAML is based on XML, and shares many of its language features. Some
    					of the language features that are directly relevant to the stated intent
    					of SC4.1.1 and to 4.1.1 related techniques include: </p>
         <ul>
            <li> Well-formedness: The definition of well-formed XAML is the same
    					as the XML definition. XAML processors, including the Silverlight
    					runtime XAML parser, will block loading XAML that is not well formed. </li>
            <li> Duplicate attributes: Unless specially configured for scenarios
    						such as design-time support, XAML processors will block loading XAML
    						where elements contain duplicate attributes. </li>
            <li> Quote matching: mismatched quote matching for attribute values
    							in XAML constitutes XAML that is not well formed. </li>
         </ul>
         <p>Some XAML language features that are analogous to XML but have some
    					technology-specific differences include: </p>
         <ul>
            <li> Identifiers: XAML defines a <code class="prop">Name</code> directive, which
    					is analogous to <code class="att">xml:id</code> in that <code class="prop">Name</code> serves
    					as the unique identifier of an element. However, XAML defines an
    					additional concept of a XAML namescope, which permits a XAML document
    					to contain multiple XAML namescopes as a factoring technique. Thus,
    					identical <code class="prop">Name</code> values are permitted in a XAML document
    					so long as each is defined in a separate XAML namescope. XAML namescopes
    					are associated with elements, such that the extent of each XAML namescope
    					is understood by XAML processors. </li>
            <li> Schemas and vocabularies: A notable difference between XAML and
    						XML is that a XAML vocabulary is not typically represented in existing
    						XML schema definition formats such as XSD or DTD. XAML includes inheritance
    						and reference features that cannot adequately be expressed in XSD
    						or other existing XML schema representation formats. This affects
    						the "elements are nested according to their specifications"   consideration
    						of SC4.1.1. XAML definitely has the ability to enforce nesting restrictions
    						as represented by a XAML vocabulary. However, XAML validity for a
    						vocabulary is deliberately fluid, in order to support extension by
    						user code. XAML validity is determined by a combination of a XAML
    						processor, a XAML concept known as a XAML schema context, and the
    						code that backs the XAML and defines any objects being instantiated
    						as a parsing result. Typically, design time tools such as Microsoft
    						Visual Studio can adequately duplicate the runtime validity characteristics
    						of a XAML vocabulary. Using these tools, application authors can
    						both verify XAML validity as well as receive design-time information
    						for how to correct any XAML validity errors. </li>
         </ul>

         <h4> XAML parsing and HTML parsing </h4>
         <p>In the Silverlight implementation, XAML is like HTML in that it is
    					loaded and parsed just-in-time. Silverlight XAML is not precompiled
    					to binary or MSIL (the language-neutral CLR runtime format). Instead,Silverlight
    					XAML is transmitted or stored as plain text, either loose or packaged
    					as resources in a library. Thus Silverlight XAML is human readable
    					as well as machine readable. </p>
         <p>However, unlike HTML, Silverlight XAML is only intended to be loaded
    					and interpreted by the Silverlight runtime, rather than multiple possible
    					user agents that each implement an HTML engine. HTML is a language
    					where the behavior is also specified. In contrast, XAML is a language
    					for referencing constructs that are defined in runtime libraries, and
    					the functional specification of the XAML language itself is minimal
    					(intrinsics; language rules; primitive types). Layout, appearance,
    					type-member sets, roles, etc. are all left up to specific frameworks
    					and vocabularies that use XAML. Behavior associated with a given XAML
    					construct is based on type definitions made in a runtime library. For
    					Silverlight XAML, the types are from Silverlight core libraries, but
    					often the definitions come from libraries that are available to the
    					Silverlight runtime as part of an application's packaging for distribution. </p>
         <p>XAML is generally speaking strict, and will raise parsing errors if
    					XAML contains elements that are not recognized. Such parsing errors
    					generally present the information in the XAML from resulting in any
    					objects being created, which in turn prevents a Silverlight application
    					from running. This is different from typical (non-xHTML) HTML, where
    					implementations are permitted to contain nonrecognized elements or
    					attributes and ignore them. </p>

               <h4> More about design tools and XAML </h4>
               <p>Silverlight XAML is able to be loaded by design tools for Silverlight.
    							In the design tool, the XAML is interpreted much like the runtime interprets
    							it, in order to show the visual representation of the Silverlight application.
    							In addition, the design tool might implement design surfaces in which
    							the user interface can be changed, and typically provides a way to
    							save any changes made in the tool back into the loaded XAML. </p>
               <p>At design time, tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio or Microsoft
    							Expression might provide opportunities to correct any XAML errors before
    							the Silverlight application is compiled and packaged for deployment.
    							This might be implemented by performing static analysis of the XAML,
    							by forwarding the design tool's own parser errors as it renders the
    							design surface, or by forwarding linking errors that are identified
    							by a precompile step (for example, missing event handlers raise a XAML
    							error from precompile). This behavior is sometimes identified as a <em>design
    								mode</em> behavior in Microsoft documentation and other documentation
    							about Visual Studio or specific tools. </p>
               <p>Regardless of how a given XAML file behaves while being interacted
    							with in a design mode, it is the Silverlight runtime XAML parser on
    							each client installation that is the ultimate determinant of whether
    							the XAML is valid or invalid. </p>

    					also possible that the application is production-ready, and deliberately
    					does not expose any JavaScript errors, whether Silverlight managed
    					code errors or not. If seeing the specific error is important, the
    					test might need to be run against a preproduction or debug version
    					of the application. </p>
