      <p>The objective of this technique is to introduce key handling that
    				exists at the application root level of a Silverlight application,
    				rather than per-element key handling. Event handling at the application
    				level as opposed to at the element level is one way to address key
    				equivalence. The key events provide key equivalence for particular
    				user interface elements that a user might otherwise interact with using
    				a mouse. This technique is related to events in the Silverlight programming
    				model, as opposed to in the HTML DOM. </p>
      <p>Handling key events at the root level of an application rather than
    				only on the element that was the "source" of a key event
    				is possible because of a Silverlight programming model feature known
    				as event routing. For more information on event routing and how it
    				works, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189018(VS.95).aspx">Events
    					Overview for Silverlight</a>. </p>
      <p>This technique demonstrates a "menu" approach to key handling
    				and user interaction. This technique is presented as a companion to <a href="#SL9"></a>, which
    				can be thought of as an "accelerator key/hotkey" approach.
    				The   "menu" approach towards keyboard equivalence is perhaps
    				just as common as the "hotkey" approach. It is often simpler
    				to document a menu's key equivalence in a user interface than it is
    				to document key equivalents of particular regions of an application,
    				or to communicate to users that where the current focus is placed is
    				relevant to how keyboard keys are interpreted by the application, even
    				if the key action is relevant to only one of the controls in an interface.
    				If all keys are handled at the top level, the specific focused element
    				is no longer relevant. </p>
      <p>In order to originate a key event that Silverlight application code
    				can detect, some element in the Silverlight application must have keyboard
    				focus. One way to assure keyboard focus is to focus the Silverlight
    				plug-in as a whole, as called from within an event handler for Application.Startup.
    				This is shown in the examples. </p>
      <p>If an application does handle keys at top level, care should be taken
    				to not interfere with specific text entry control behavior, such as
    				typing into a <code class="obj">TextBox</code>. To avoid interactions, the
    				design of key equivalence at the top level of an application typically
    				relies on combinations with key modifiers. The Control/CTRL key is
    				a key that is often used for this purpose. Application authors should
    				also be aware of the implications of browser hosts that might handle
    				the key event at HTML DOM level without making that event available
    				to the Silverlight programming surface. For more information on this
    				concept, see "Keyboard Events and Browser Hosts" section
    				of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189015(VS.95).aspx">Keyboard
    					Support Overview for Silverlight on MSDN</a>. </p>
      <p>Application authors are responsible for correctly documenting the
    				accelerator keys that are pertinent for their application. There are
    				a variety of techniques for documenting user interface actions that
    				are not described here. One possible suggestion is to include a generalized "Help" button
    				that appears early in the application's reading order, which is focusable
    				and has an <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> value available as the text content
    				or equivalent. Such a button can be activated without knowing any of
    				the application's accelerator keys, and the activation result could
    				be a new text element that enumerates the possible keys. For example,
    				the application could display a Silverlight <code class="obj">Popup</code> with
    				the following content: </p>
      <figure id="figure-silverlight-popup-control">
         <img src="img/popup_keys.png" />
            
            <figcaption>A screen shot of a sample Popup control that documents specific accelerator keys</figcaption>
          
      </figure>

         <h3>Key handling by application root UserControl</h3>
         
            <p>This example has only one interactive control for simplicity, but
    						with two possible key combinations for that control being handled as
    						actions. The purpose and explanation of the control is reported through
    						a <code class="obj">TextBlock</code> that is associated with the labeled control
    						through use of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.automation.automationproperties.labeledby%28VS.95%29.aspx">AutomationProperties.LabeledBy</a> in
    						XAML. The control being illustrated is <code class="obj">MultiScaleImage</code>,
    						which supports a zoom-in metaphor for examining an image that redraws
    						at increasingly fine resolutions. For more information on <code class="obj">MultiScaleImage</code>,

         <ol>
            <li> Using a browser that supports Silverlight, open an HTML page that
    					references a Silverlight application through an object tag. </li>
            <li> Verify that keyboard focus is somewhere within the Silverlight
    						content area, and not elsewhere in the hosting HTML or hosting browser
    						user interface. If necessary, use TAB key to traverse the overall
    						HTML tab sequence until an interface element within Silverlight displays
    						a visual focus indicator. </li>
            <li> Verify that the keys to be used as keyboard equivalent action
    							triggers for the application as a whole are documented for users.
    							For example, text or long text alternative documents key / key combinations
    							and short descriptions of actions. </li>
            <li> Verify that pressing the application-specific keys results in
    					the action as expected in the application. </li>
            <li> Move keyboard focus throughout other areas of the Silverlight
    					application, and verify that the same keys continue to function application-wide. </li>
