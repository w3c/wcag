            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to use the combination of HTML
               				<code class="att">Lang</code> attribute, <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> and <code class="prop">Language</code> to
               				correctly specify the language of the entirety of Silverlight content,
               				or of parts within the Silverlight content. 
            </p>
            <p>In general, Silverlight does not attempt to repurpose HTML Lang, because
               				Silverlight is not HTML. Instead, internally within the Silverlight
               				content area, Silverlight uses language definition concepts that relate
               				to XML (<code class="prop">Language</code> is a remapping of xml:lang) or .NET
               				Framework programming (<code class="obj">CultureInfo</code>). For these reasons,
               				HTML Lang techniques as described in [<a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/html/H58">H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language </a>]
               				are not useful for Silverlight programming of Silverlight-specific "parts". 
            </p>
            <p>What becomes important in Silverlight application programming then
               				is to make sure that the HTML language concept of Lang and the Silverlight
               				language concept of CultureInfo or Lang are not at odds with one another,
               				or reporting misinformation. In particular, application authors should
               				avoid situations where an assistive technology has HTML Lang available
               				for programmatic determination of either page or part, but the effective
               				runtime language in the Silverlight part is different. The result here
               				might be that a screen reader that changes functionality such as phonetic
               				pronunciations would not correctly read the text content from the Silverlight
               				content. Avoiding this situation is largely a matter of due diligence
               				on the part of a Silverlight application author, OR on the part of
               				the Web page author who authors surrounding HTML, in cases where a
               				Web page is embedding Silverlight content or packages that the Web
               				page's author did not actively develop and is only consuming/embedding. 
            </p>
            <p>The following is a general recommendation that summarizes the detailed
               				discussion in subsequent subheadings: 
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li> If the Silverlight application does not have a strong emphasis
                  				on presenting textual information with a particular language association,
                  				HTML Lang should be left blank. This causes assistive technologies
                  				to defer to either user agent or platform language settings. Silverlight
                  				is able to determine these same language values at run time, and
                  				language behavior of assistive technologies and of Silverlight is
                  				kept synchronized through the use of the same external information
                  				set. 
               </li>
               
               <li> If the Silverlight application DOES have a strong emphasis on
                  					presenting textual information with A SINGLE particular language
                  					association, HTML Lang should be assigned to report that specific
                  					language either for whole page or at least for the Silverlight object
                  					tag. This enables assistive technologies to pick up the value, per <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/html/H57">H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element</a>. Aside from
                  					due diligence during development and deployment, Silverlight application
                  					code might choose to enforce that its runtime CultureInfo is really
                  					the same. This could be addressed with a specific HTML DOM helper
                  					function. 
               </li>
               
               <li> If the Silverlight application has MULTIPLE language associations,
                  						the best option is to separate the Silverlight application into object
                  						parts at the HTML level, to assure that HTML Lang and intended runtime
                  						language do not clash. This is particularly important if the application
                  						is actively resetting CurrentCulture away from the user settings
                  						of platform or user agent. For more information, see <a href="#SL4"></a>. 
               </li>
               
            </ul>

               <h3> HTML Lang </h3>
               
               <p>When Silverlight is embedded in an HTML document with the   &lt;object&gt; element,
                  					the value of the HTML <code class="att">Lang</code> attribute of the surrounding HTML becomes
                  					a factor. Browsers process the outer HTML, and the browser's processing
                  					has possible influence over values reported to any DOM script that
                  					acts, or to any accessibility framework that is reporting the browser
                  					content. The preferred way for a Silverlight application to address <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page">SC
                     						3.1.1</a> is to correctly specify the HTML Lang value in the hosting
                  					HTML page. This technique should be used in conjunction with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/html/H57">H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element</a>. By using the
                  					same language values with both techniques as a better practice, H57
                  					will satisfy 3.1.1 while setting the language value of the Silverlight
                  					content to match will assist authors in meeting SC 3.1.2. 
               </p>
               
               <p>The Silverlight runtime itself does not attempt to inherit language
                  					settings that come from markup that is outside the Silverlight-specific
                  					content. In particular, the HTML <code class="att">Lang</code> attribute applied to the html
                  					tag, Lang on host object tag, specific parameters of the Silverlight
                  					object tag, all have no affect on the value of any Silverlight <code class="prop">Language</code> attribute.
                  					Instead, the Silverlight <code class="prop">Language</code> defaults to the <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> of
                  					the Silverlight runtime as instantiated by HTML object tag invocation.
                  					It is expected that if a Silverlight application contains extensive
                  					text where language of text is a factor for assistive technology purposes,
                  					developers will manually set the HTML Lang tag to match the <code class="prop">Language</code> value
                  					on the Silverlight root element in XAML. Development tools might or
                  					might not enforce or inform the relationship between HTML Lang and
                  					Silverlight <code class="prop">Language</code>; that consideration is outside
                  					the scope of Silverlight as a technology. If language is not a major
                  					factor in the application, application authors should consider leaving
                  					HTML Lang blank on the hosting HTML page. 
               </p>
               
               <p>You can programatically determine the value of HTML Lang of surrounding
                  					HTML from within the Silverlight API, by using the DOM-bridging method <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.browser.htmlelement.getattribute%28VS.95%29.aspx">HtmlElement.GetAttribute</a>.
                  					Otherwise, this can be determined by techniques other than Silverlight's
                  					(such as scripting to the HTML DOM of the hosting browser).

               <p>
                  <code class="prop">Language</code> is an attribute that is available on all
                  					Silverlight objects that directly represent a UI element. Language
                  					can be queried (or set) by Silverlight managed code run time, such
                  					that the <code class="prop">Language</code> value can be programatically determined
                  					within the Silverlight programming model. 
               </p>
               
               <p>The format of the value that is used to set <code class="prop">Language</code> is
                  					based on ISO-639-1, and is thus compatible with <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt</a>. 
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  <code class="prop">Language</code> has a behavior that parallels the behavior
                  					of <code class="att">xml:lang</code> in an XML document: if <code class="prop">Language</code> is set on
                  					a parent element, all child elements inherit that <code class="prop">Language</code> value.
                  					An actual <code class="att">xml:lang</code> attribute in XAML is also valid for this purpose. 
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  <code class="prop">Language</code> can be set at the root of a XAML document,
                  					so that the entire UI shares the same language setting. If <code class="prop">Language</code> is
                  					not explicitly set at the root by application markup, <code class="prop">Language</code> is
                  					inferred per running instance, based on processing the acting <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> at
                  					run time. 
               </p>
               
               <p>However, another usage is for application authors to set <code class="prop">Language</code> on
                  					a specific child element, to override the root-level or client-environment-inferred
                  <code class="prop">Language</code> value.
                  					This enables consciously embedding a content part that is deliberately
                  					in a different language than the remainder of the Silverlight content. 
               </p>
               
               <p>Exactly what happens when a <code class="prop">Language</code> is set on a
                  					part is not always specified, and is largely a matter of implementation
                  					detail of the individual Silverlight classes that might be a "part".
                  					However, as an informative generalization, the value of <code class="prop">Language</code> might
                  					affect considerations such as: how white space is processed (in particular
                  					CR or LF); character sets for fonts; string formatting when using APIs
                  					specifically on that part.

               <p>
                  <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> is a concept that is relevant to .NET
                  					Framework programming. This concept applies to Silverlight because
                  					Silverlight uses a specific implementation of a CLR runtime that uses
                  					.NET Framework principles. <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> potentially
                  					specifies both a language and a culture. This distinction becomes relevant
                  					for advanced string formatting concepts that are provided in the .NET
                  					Framework, such as decimal separators, dates, and currency. For example,
                  					an application author might simply specify "en" if the author
                  					did not care about string formatting, but might specify "en-GB" if
                  					the application was using string formatting for currency values with
                  					the intention of displaying Pounds Sterling as currency unit in string
                  					formatting. 
               </p>
               
               <p>Silverlight applications often run using an inferred <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> based
                  					on the operating system where the user agent browser host exists (in
                  					other words, the culture of the client computer where the Silverlight
                  					application is run). This <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> can be queried
                  					by applications at run time; see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture%28VS.95%29.aspx">CultureInfo.CurrentCulture</a>.
                  					Application authors can deliberately constrain the set of <code class="obj">CultureInfo</code> cases
                  					that a Silverlight application can be run under, in order to verify
                  					that necessary string resources for that culture are available in that
                  					application. This is done by setting &lt;SupportedCultures&gt; in the
                  					Silverlight project settings. If a user accesses the application on
                  					a client that is outside the SupportedCultures, the application author
                  					has the following choices: 
               </p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li> Use a fallback resource set representing a neutral culture; this
                     					is enabled automatically by the Silverlight resources lookup behavior,
                     					so long as the project includes resources identified as being culture-neutral.
                     					This is the preferred approach. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Use client logic to detect the culture, and initiate a client-side
                     						redirect to request either a different XAP or a different hosting
                     						HTML page. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Trap requests at the server level by checking lang request in
                     							the header. This varies between server implementations, is not a
                     							Silverlight-specific technique, and is not discussed here.

                  					threads can be run as separate cultures, but that is not discussed
                  					here and is not relevant because only the main UI thread has relevance
                  					to Web content accessibility. So, if an application author wants to
                  					declare specific language settings for a part (component, region or
                  					control) of the Silverlight application, a different Silverlight-specific

            <p>These examples show Silverlight behaviors that are based on interpreting
               				the <code class="prop">Language</code> property value, as a way of illustrating
               				the programmatic determination of language values specifically in the
               				Silverlight application framework. To determine HTML Lang, application
               				authors should use the HTML DOM as enabled by browser host scripting,
               				rather than Silverlight APIs. HTML DOM techniques are not shown here
               				because they are specific to browsers or scripting frameworks, not
               				to Silverlight.
