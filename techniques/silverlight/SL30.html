            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to properly apply Silverlight control
               				composition techniques that can present text and non-text in UI as
               				part of the same control. This technique explains the consequences
               				that using control composition has on how that control is reported
               				to the accessibility frameworks that Silverlight supports. 
            </p>
            <p>Silverlight control composition concepts are relevant either to Silverlight
               				developers who define and package a Silverlight control for use by
               				other Silverlight authors, or for Silverlight application authors that
               				use Silverlight controls in their UI but use the content properties
               				of such controls to include several other elements in a composite layout. 
            </p>
            <p>In Silverlight programming and UI definition, Silverlight authors can use control
               				composition to define a parent control that initiates an action. The
               				control can have component parts, such as text and non-text composition
               				pieces that display within the control and have equivalent meaning.
               				Silverlight authors can rely on the text component of the control to
               				provide any text alternative for purposes other than the accessibility
               				framework. However, Silverlight authors should declare alternative
               				text on the control that is specifically consumed by accessibility
               				frameworks, by setting <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> as
               				an attribute in XAML. In most cases, this text can be the same as the
               				visible text in the control composition, per the definition of 'label'
               				in SC 4.1.2. 
            </p>
            <p>Note that this technique does not result in a duplication of text,
               				as explained in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/html/H2">H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource</a>.
               				This is because the element parts of control composition are either
               				inherently not focusable separately, or can be specified by instance-specific
               				properties to behave as if they cannot be focused. The parts in Silverlight
               				composition are not promoted to the accessibility frameworks as parts
               				of an application-specific UI Automation tree, so that control composition
               				as an implementation detail does not interfere with the usage of controls
               				by Silverlight application authors. The primary source of accessibility-related
               				information is the specific <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> property
               				as set on the parent control in the composition, which is set by the
               				application author rather than the control author. 
            </p>
            <p>The control author does specify the information that is reported to
               				accessibility frameworks as the "ClassName", which is often
               				used by assistive technologies for identification purposes and is appended
               				to any "Name" value. For example, if an application author
               				includes a   "Widget" control, and gives it an <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> value
               				of "Show Map", an assistive technology might identify the
               				element as   "Show Map widget". The "Show Map" part
               				comes from the application author code, and the "widget" part
               				comes from the Widget control implementation code. 
            </p>

               <h3>Example 1: Button is composed with a StackPanel that contains nontext
                  					and text content
               </h3>
               <p>In this example the <code class="obj">TextBlock</code> that goes with the
                  						graphic image conveys the text information for non-accessibility purposes.
                  						The <code class="obj">Button</code> has internal composition that combines
                  						text from a non-focusable <code class="obj">TextBlock</code> part and an image
                  						part. Therefore the "Pause" Text is not promoted to serve
                  						as "Name" through built-in <code class="obj">Button</code> automation
                  						peer logic. The Silverlight application author is responsible for explicitly
                  						setting <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> on the <code class="obj">Button</code> so
                  						that the text equivalent is available to the accessibility framework.
                  						This example shows the XAML UI. The logic, which might be attached
                  						to <code class="obj">Button</code> with a Click handler, is
                  						not shown.

               <p>This example is similar to Example 1 and produces the same result
                  						at run time. This example shows the preferred technique of using the
