      <ul id="silverlight.applicability.general">
         <li> Microsoft Silverlight, versions 3 and greater </li>
         <li> Silverlight managed programming model and Silverlight XAML </li>
      </ul>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to use the Silverlight <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> property
    				to provide a short text alternative for controls that do not otherwise
    				contain text. The text is intended to provide human-readable identifiers
    				and short-descriptions or user instructions for accessibility frameworks,
    				which can then be reported to assistive technologies. </p>
      <p>"Control" in this technique refers to any element that is
    				based on the Silverlight <code class="obj">Control</code> class, and is keyboard-focusable
    				either by user action or calling focus to the control programmatically.
    				The non-text control in question might be something like a button that
    				communicates information using only an icon or image. For example,
    				a triangle image rotated 90 degrees clockwise is commonly used in many
    				user interfaces to indicate a "Play"   button control. This "Play" icon
    				mimics interface metaphors from many non-software consumer products,
    				and is often presented in a user interface without any nearby visible
    				text information that explains the purpose of the control. Another
    				example is a "thumbnail" metaphor where a small image serves
    				as a control that can be activated, and where the action results in
    				the display of a larger version of the same image, or enters an editing
    				mode that loads the same image. </p>
      <p>For cases of controls such as buttons that invoke actions, the text
    				alternative also identifies link purpose. </p>
      <p>In Silverlight, a text-only identifier for any control can be set
    				specifically as <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> on the parent
    				control. Silverlight control compositing techniques enable either per-control
    				images that are specified by the application author, or a general-purpose
    				image/icon for a control that is part of the control's template and
    				displays that way by default. The Silverlight API <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> directly
    				sets <code class="prop">Name</code> in the UI Automation tree. The properties
    				in the UI Automation tree are reported to assistive technologies, when
    				the assistive technology implements behavior that acts as a UI Automation
    				client (or as an MSAA client, which relies on the UIA-MSAA bridge). </p>

         <h3>Applying a text alternative for an icon Button with
    					XAML</h3>
         
            <p>Application authors can specify the <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> attribute
    						on the <code class="obj">Button</code> element, and leave accessibility information
    						for the composited <code class="obj">Image</code> content unspecified. It is
    						the button and its action that is relevant to users, not the non-interactive <code class="obj">Image</code> component.
    						The value provided for <code class="prop">AutomationProperties.Name</code> is
    						a meaningful text alternative for the action conveyed by the button's
    						icon/image, but where the functionality is conceptually embodied in
    						the button and not its images or other constituent parts in compositing
    						or visual design. </p>
