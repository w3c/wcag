            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/keyboard">Success Criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard</a> (Sufficient when used with <a href="../general/G90">G90: Providing keyboard-triggered event handlers</a>)</span>.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
               The objective of this technique is to illustrate the use of both keyboard-specific
               and mouse-specific events with code that has a scripting function associated with
               an event. Using both keyboard-specific and mouse-specific events together ensures
               that content can be operated by a wide range of devices. For example, a script may
               perform the same action when a keypress is detected that is performed when a mouse
               button is clicked. This technique goes beyond the Success Criterion requirement for
               keyboard access by including not only keyboard access but access using other devices
               as well. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               In JavaScript, commonly used event handlers include, onblur, onchange, onclick, ondblclick,
               onfocus, onkeydown, onkeypress, onkeyup, onload, onmousedown, onmousemove, onmouseout,
               onmouseover, onmouseup, onreset, onselect, onsubmit, onunload. Some mouse-specific
               functions have a logical corresponding keyboard-specific function (such as 'onmouseover'
               and 'onfocus'). A keyboard event handler should be provided that executes the same
               function as the mouse event handler.
               
            </p>

               The following table suggests keyboard event handlers to pair mouse event handlers.

               						   <sup>1</sup> Although click is in principle a mouse event handler, most HTML and XHTML user agents
               also process this event when a native HTML control (e.g. a button or a link) is activated,
               regardless of whether it was activated with the mouse or the keyboard. In practice,
               therefore, it is not necessary to duplicate this event when adding handlers to natively
               focusable HTML elements. However, it is necessary when adding handlers to other events,
               such as in Example 2 below.
            </p>
            <p>
               						   <sup>2</sup> Since the keypress event handler reacts to any key, the event handler function should
               check first to ensure the Enter key was pressed before proceeding to handle the event.
               Otherwise, the event handler will run each time the user presses any key, even the
               tab key to leave the control, and this is usually not desirable.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Some mouse-specific functions (such as dblclick and mousemove) do  not have a corresponding
               keyboard-specific function. This means that some functions may need  to be implemented
               differently for each device (for example, including a series of buttons to execute,
               via keyboard, the equivalent mouse-specific functions implemented).

               <p>In this example of an image link, the image is changed when the user positions the
                  pointer over the image. To provide keyboard users with a similar experience, the image
                  is also changed when the user tabs to it.

                  								This example shows a custom image control for which both the mouse and the
                  keyboard can be used to activate the function. The mouse event onclick is duplicated
                  by an appropriate keyboard event onkeypress. The tabindex attribute ensures that the
                  keyboard will have a tab stop on the image. Note that in this example, the nextPage()
                  function should check that the keyboard key pressed was Enter, otherwise it will respond
                  to all keyboard actions while the image has focus, which is not the desired behavior.
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve">
&lt;img onclick="nextPage();" onkeypress="nextPage();" tabindex="0" src="arrow.gif"

                     <p>This example uses tabindex on an img element. Even though this is currently invalid,
                        it is provided as a transitional technique to make this function work. Custom controls
                        like this should also use WAI-ARIA to expose the role and state of the control.
