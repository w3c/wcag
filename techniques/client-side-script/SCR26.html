            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific

            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to place inserted user interface elements into
               the Document Object Model (DOM) in such a way that the tab order and screen-reader
               reading order are set correctly by the default behavior of the user agent. This technique
               can be used for any user interface element that is hidden and shown, such as menus
               and dialogs.
            </p>
            <p>The reading order in a screen-reader is based on the order of the HTML or XHTML elements
               in the Document Object Model, as is the default tab order. This technique inserts
               new content into the DOM immediately following the element that was activated to trigger
               the script. The triggering element must be a link or a button, and the script must
               be called from its onclick event. These elements are natively focusable, and their
               onclick event is device independent. Focus remains on the activated element and the
               new content, inserted after it, becomes the next thing in both the tab order and screen-reader
               reading order.
            </p>
            <p>Note that this technique works for synchronous updates. For asynchronous updates (sometimes
               called AJAX), an additional technique is needed to inform the assistive technology
               that the asynchronous content has been inserted.

               <h3>Example 1</h3>
               <p>This example creates a menu when a link is clicked and inserts it after the link.
                  The onclick event of the link is used to call the ShowHide script, passing in an ID
                  for the new menu as a parameter.
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;a href="#" onclick="ShowHide('foo',this)"&gt;Toggle&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>The ShowHide script creates a div containing the new menu, and inserts a link into
                  it. The last line is the core of the script. It finds the parent of the element that
                  triggered the script, and appends the div it created as a new child to it. This causes
                  the new div to be in the DOM after the link. When the user hits tab, the focus will
                  go to the first focusable item in the menu, the link we created.
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve">function ShowHide(id,src)
{
	var el = document.getElementById(id);
	if (!el)

		el = document.createElement("div");
		el.id = id;
		var link = document.createElement("a");
		link.href = "javascript:void(0)";
		link.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Content"));
		el.appendChild(link);
		src.parentElement.appendChild(el);
	}
