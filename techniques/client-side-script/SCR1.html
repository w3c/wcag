            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to allow user to extend the default time limit
               by providing a mechanism to extend the time when scripts provide functionality that
               has default time limits. In order to allow the user to request a longer time limit,
               the script can provide a form (for example) allowing the user to enter a larger time
               limit or indicating that more time is needed. If the user is being warned that a time
               limit is about to expire (see <a href="#SCR16"></a>), this form can be made available from the warning dialog. The user can extend the
               time limit to at least 10 times the default time limit, either by allowing the user
               to indicate how much additional time is needed or by repeatedly allowing the user
               to extend the time limit.

                  A Web page contains current stock market statistics and is set to refresh periodically.
                  When the user is warned prior to refreshing the first time, the user is provided with
                  an option to extend the time period between refreshes.

                  with an option to increase the time.
