  <h2>When to Use</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript animation which causes motion that is triggered by user interactions.

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users to prevent animations (including motion animations) from being displayed on web pages, by using JavaScript to evaluate the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> CSS Media Query.</p>
  <p>Some users experience distraction or nausea from animated content. For example, if scrolling a page causes elements to move (other than the essential movement associated with scrolling the content, which is under the user's control) it can trigger vestibular disorders.</p>
  <p>Media queries that selectively enable/disable JavaScript-driven animations based on operating system or user agent preferences allow users to avoid those triggers.</p>
  <p>The understanding document for <a href="../../Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html#resources">Animation from Interactions</a> includes links for changing the 'reduced motion' setting.</p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <section class="example">
    <h3>Evaluating the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> CSS Media Query in JavaScript</h3>
    <p>Users can indicate their motion preference for interfaces in their system. This choice can be detected in JavaScript by evaluating the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> CSS Media Query. The script can then decide to enable or disable animation effects based on the result of the media query test.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const mediaQueryList = window.matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)");

if (mediaQueryList.matches) {
  /* The user has not expressed a preference for reduced motion – run JavaScript-based animation */
}
</code></pre>

  <h2>Tests</h2>
  <section class="test-procedure">
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p>For each interactive element that triggers a motion animation as a result of a user interaction:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enable the reduced motion setting in your system;</li>
      <li>Check that the motion animation is essential;</li>
      <li>Check that the motion animation is suppressed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Expected Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>#2 or #3 is true.</li>
