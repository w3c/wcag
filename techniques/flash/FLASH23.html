      <ul id="flash.applicability.general">
         <li>Adobe Flash Professional version MX and higher </li>
         <li>Adobe Flex</li>
      </ul>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a brief overview of
    				how data has been organized into a DataGrid or a brief explanation
    				of how to navigate the grid. </p>
      <p>As Flash does not provide a summary attribute, this descriptive text
    				will be added to the DataGrid's accessible desription instead. This
    				approach will make the summary information available to people who
    				use screen readers; the information is not displayed visually. </p>
      <p>The summary is useful when the table has a complex structure (for
    				example, when there are several sets of row or column headers, or when
    				there are multiple groups of columns or rows). The summary may also
    				be helpful for simple data tables that contain many columns or rows
    				of data. </p>

         <h3>Adding a summary to a DataGrid in the Accessibility control panel</h3>
         
            <p>This is an example of a DataGrid being added to the stage in Flash
    						Professional from the Components panel. The description field is used
    						in the Accessibility control panel in Flash to serve as the summary
    						information for the DataGrid. </p>
            <ol>
               <li> Create a new Flash file (.fla) or open an existing one to put
    						a DataGrid into. </li>
               <li> Open the Flash components panel from the Window menu </li>
               <li> Drag a DataGrid component onto the stage and position as desired. </li>
               <li> Select the DataGrid component and add the summary information
    							to the description field for DataGrid, using the Accessibility control
