            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to allow keyboard focus to move to and from Flash
               content embedded in a web page. In browsers other than Internet   Explorer, there
               is a problem related to keyboard accessibility of   embedded Flash content. The problem
               is that, while both the Flash   content and the HTML content around it may be keyboard
               accessible, many browsers do not support moving keyboard focus between the Flash content
               and HTML   content without using a mouse. Once focus is placed inside the Flash  
               content, a keyboard user will be trapped there. Similarly, when focus is   placed
               somewhere else on the HTML content (outside the Flash content), it   will be impossible
               to move focus into the content.  This technique is designed to let the Flash author
               address this issue and provide support for moving focus between the Flash content
               and the HTML content via the keyboard. 
            </p>
            <p>This issue has been around for a long time, and is related to the   way browsers implement
               embedded plug-ins. Until this problem is fixed,   it is up to the Flash developer
               to come up with a work around. This   technique is one of those workarounds. The approach
               behind this   technique is the following: 
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li> Two 'neighbor' focusable HTML objects are identified for each   Flash content in
                  the document (one before and one after the content). These   elements can be any HTML
                  elements that are part of the web page's tab   order (such as links and form controls).
                  
               </li>
               
               <li> The Flash content object itself is added to the document tab   order as well, making
                  it possible to tab into the content. 
               </li>
               
               <li> Inside the Flash content, the Flash Player maintains its own tab   order. Normally,
                  when the start or end of the Flash tab order is   reached (when tabbing through the
                  content), focus will wrap to the   beginning or end of the content's tab order, and
                  it will not be possible   to (shift) tab out of it. With this technique however, when
                  a 'focus   wrap' is detected focus will instead be moved to the neighboring element
                  in the HTML tab order (allowing a keyboard user to 'break out' of the   Flash tab
                  order). 
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>When the SWFFocus class is imported into a Flash project, the   following will happen:
               
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p> A JavaScript &lt;script&gt; tag will be generated   and added to the HTML document containing
                     the Flash content. This   JavaScript code will:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li> Set a tabIndex value of "0" on the &lt;object&gt; element of   each Flash content found
                        in the page. This causes the Flash objects to   become part of the tab order. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> Optionally, create a hidden anchor element before and after   the Flash content,
                        which is used by the SWFFocus class to move focus out   of the Flash content back
                        into the HTML page. Alternatively, the developer   can specify existing focusable
                        HTML elements as adjacent tab stops for   the Flash content. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> Set event handlers for the Flash content object, so that when it   receives focus,
                        the SWFFocus class is notified to manage the content's   internal tab order. 
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </li>
               
               <li> The SWFFocus class monitors changes in focus within the Flash   content. When a focus
                  wrap is detected in the content, a JavaScript function   will be called to instead
                  move focus back to the neighboring HTML   content. 
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>As indicated above, there are two ways in which this technique can be   used: </p>
            <ol>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>Letting the SWFFocus class generate neighboring focusable   elements in the HTML tab
                     order for each Flash content (demonstrated in   example 1 below)
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>By default, the SWFFocus class will create a hidden link   element before and after
                     an embedded Flash content. These elements are   needed as 'anchor' to move focus to
                     when (shift) tabbing out of the   Flash content. This approach is the easiest to implement,
                     as it does not   require any additional work by the developer. The downside is that
                     the   hidden links will clutter the HTML tab order with meaningless elements   (although
                     these elements are only used as tab stops when tabbing _out   of_ the Flash content,
                     not when tabbing _into_ it). Because of this, it is   recommended to use the following
                     approach instead:
                  </p>
                  
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>Explicitly identifying focusable HTML elements that come before   and after the a
                     Flash content in the HTML tab order (demonstrated in   example 2 below)
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>With this approach, the developer can use ID values to   identify the elements that
                     come before and after the Flash content in the   HTML tab order. This is done by setting
                     special class names on the Flash   content's &lt;object&gt; element. This is the preferred
                     approach, as it does not cause an unnecessary cluttering of the tab   order. However,
                     it does require more work and awareness by the developer   (who has to manually set
                     ID values). Also, in some scenarios there   simply may not be a next or previous focusable
                     element for a Flash   content.

               <h3>Example 1: Using automatically generated links</h3>
               <p>In this example, the SWFFocus class is used without explicitly   identifying focusable
                  HTML elements. This will cause SWFFocus to   dynamically insert hidden links before
                  and after the Flash content. 
               </p>
               <p class="exsubhead">Loading the Flash Content</p>
               <p>The Flash object in this example is added using <a href="https://github.com/swfobject/swfobject">SWFObject's dynamic publishing method</a>, which means   that the object tag is created dynamically by JavaScript in a way
                  that   the browser supports. While this is the recommended approach, it is not a 
                  requirement for using this technique. The SWFFocus class will also work   when the
                  object tag is hardcoded into the HTML document. 
               </p>
               <p>The sample code below shows how to load the content dynamically   with SWFObject.

&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p class="exsubhead">Importing and Initializing the SWFFocus class in Flash</p>
               <p>The SWFFocus class needs to be added to a Flash or Flex project's source   path. The
                  easiest way to achieve this is to import the SWFFocus.swc into Library path for your
                  project or to copy the   com/swffocus/SWFFocus.as file (including the nested directory
                  structure)   to the project's root directory. 
               </p>
               <p>When the SWFFocus class is added to the content's source path, it   needs to be initialized
                  with the following code: 
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve">import com.adobe.swffocus.SWFFocus;
SWFFocus.init(stage);</pre><p>The code for the class itself can be found in the source files.</p>

               <h3>Example 2: Explicitly identifying existing focusable html element</h3>
               <p>For a large part, this technique is the same as example 1 : </p>
               <ul>
                  
                  <li> The dynamic loading approach by SWFObject is used to load the   Flash content </li>
                  
                  <li> The SWFFocus class needs to be added to the content's sourcepath   and initialized
                     in the Flash content 
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               <p>For more details about these steps, see example 1. </p>
               <p>In this case however, special class names are added to the Flash   content object.
                  These class names indicate the ID values of the elements   previous and next of the
                  content in the HTML tab order. The class names   are: 
               </p>
               <ul>
                  
                  <li> 'swfPref-&lt;previous ID&gt;', where '&lt;previous element&gt;'   should be the ID value of the
                     previous element in the tab order. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> 'swfNext-&lt;next ID&gt;', where '&lt;next element&gt;' should   be the ID value of the next
                     element in the tab order. 
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               <p>For example, the HTML code could look like this (notice the added   class names on
                  the object tag): 
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" id="focus1"&gt;test 1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;object class="swfPrev-focus1 swfNext-focus2"

  type="application/x-shockwave-flash"/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" id="focus2"&gt;test 2&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>Since this example uses SWFObject's dynamic loading, the class names   will have to
                  be specified as attribute when SWFObject is initialized.   This is demonstrated in
                  the code example below.

    &lt;script src="swfobject_2_1.js" type="text/javascript"/&gt;

    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
      var flashvars = {};
      var params = {};
      params.scale = "noscale";
      var attributes = {};
      attributes.id = "FlashSample2SWF";
      attributes.name = "FlashSample2SWF";
      attributes["class"] = "swfPrev-focus1 swfNext-focus2";
      swfobject.embedSWF("keyboard_trap_fix_as3.swf", "flashSample1", "150", 
        "200", "9.0.0", "expressInstall.swf", flashvars, params, attributes);
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" id="focus1"&gt;lorem&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following Flash content uses existing links in the document
      to move focus to when (shift) tabbing out of the Flash content.
      The existing links are defined by placing special classnames on
      the Flash object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div id="flashSample2"&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Get Adobe Flash player"
          src="http://www.adobe.com/images/shared/download_buttons/get_flash_player.gif"
        /&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.lipsum.com/"&gt;lorem&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>Note: this example assumes that the focusable HTML elements exist and   have an ID
                  value at the time SWFObject is called to insert the Flash   content. However, in some
                  situations it is also possible that these   elements do not yet exist when the Flash
                  content is created, or that the   elements will be deleted dynamically at a later
                  point. If this happens,   it is possible to reassign ID values for previous and next
                  focusable   elements. To do this, call the SWFsetFocusIds() method on the Flash  
                  content object, like so: 
               </p><pre xml:space="preserve">var o = document.getElementById("FlashSample1SWF");
o.SWFsetFocusIds('prevId', 'nextId');</pre><p>From that point on the updated IDs will be used to move focus to when   tabbing out
                  of the Flash content.
