      <ul id="flash.applicability.general">

      <p>The intent of this Technique is to ensure that information and   relationships that are implied visually by data tables are also made   available programmatically. Specifically, the association between table   column headers and their corresponding cells must be exposed to   assistive technology. In Flash, the DataGrid component can be used to   achieve this. When accessibility is enabled for the DataGrid component,   Flash will automatically prepend the column name in front of each cell   value when exposing the grid row's accessible name to assistive   technology. For example, the row in the screenshot below would be   announced by a screen reader as "Row 6 of 13 Name Patty Crawford Bats L   Throws L Year Jr Home Whittier, CA". </p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>The DataGrid component in Flash only supports column   headings, not row headings. </p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <p>For Flash content that contains tabular data: </p>
         <ol>
            <li> Open the SWF file in Internet Explorer 6 or higher (using Flash   Player 6 or higher), or Firefox 3 or higher (using Flash Player 9 or   higher) </li>
            <li> Use a tool which is capable of showing an object's   accessibility name, such as ACTF aDesigner 1.0 to open the Flash movie. </li>
            <li> In the GUI summary panel, inspect the accessibility name for   the DataGrid rows and cells to ensure that the heading data is presented   in conjunction with the data cell data. </li>
            <li> Authors may also test with a screen reader, by reading the   Flash content and listening to hear that the heading and data cell data   are read when reading the DataGrid. </li>
            <li> Authors may also verify in the Flash authoring tool that the   DataGrid component is used to structure the data and that the DataGrid   has been made accessible using the DataGridAccImpl.enableAccessibility   method. </li>
         </ol>
