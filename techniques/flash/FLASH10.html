      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a clear indication that   a specific form control in a Web application or form is required for   successful data submission. The word "required" is added to the form   control's accessible name, and a visual indicator is placed next to the   label. </p>

         <h3>Adding the word "required" to the control's accessible name</h3>
         
            <p>This example shows how to use the Accessibility panel to indicate a   field as being 'required' to users: </p>
            <ol>
               <li> Visually, place asterisk character or some other indication   adjacent to the form control's label. </li>
               <li> Use the Accessibility panel to combine the word "required"   with the control's label in the "Name" field. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This approach is illustrated in the screenshot below: </p>
