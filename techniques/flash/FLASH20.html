            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this technique is to allow the author to use   ActionScript and component
               skins to apply a strong visual indication   when a component receives focus. In this
               particular technique, both the   component's background color and border will change.
               When the component   loses focus, it returns to its normal styling. 
            </p>
            <p>The visual highlights will be applied by switching some of the   component's skin
               parts. The Standard Flash components each have their   own set of skins that make
               up the component's visual appearance. Each   part is represented by a MovieClip which
               can be edited or replaced in   order to customize how the component looks. The most
               relevant skin for   this technique is the focusRectSkin skin, which is shared   by
               all components. By default this skin applies a subtle visual   highlight when the
               component receives focus. 
            </p>
            <p>This technique can be applied through the following steps: </p>
            <ol>
               
               <li> Create a customized version of focusRectSkin. </li>
               
               <li> Use scripting to associate the component with the customized   skin. </li>
               
            </ol>
            <p>There are two ways to customize a skin: </p>
            <ol>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>Duplicating Existing Skin</p>
                  
                  <p>With this approach you create a copy of the existing focusRect skin   for modification.
                     You will manually have to apply the skin for each   individual component instance
                     (as indicated in step 5 below). 
                  </p>
                  
                  <ol>
                     
                     <li> Drag the components you want to style to the stage. This will   ensure the appropriate
                        component related skins are added to the movie's   library. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> Open the Library panel, and navigate to the "Component Assets   &gt; Shared" folder.
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> Right-click (or Ctrl-click on a Mac) on the focusRectSkin   MovieClip, and choose
                        "Duplicate" from the context menu. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> Edit the visual border in the skin's MovieClip. For example,   the focus rectangle
                        can be made thicker to stand out more (This step is   illustrated in the screenshot
                        below this list). 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> Using ActionScript, associate form component instances with   your customized version
                        of focusRectSkin. This can be achieved using the   setStyle method. 
                     </li>

                  <p> Modifying Existing Skin </p>
                  
                  <p>With this approach, the original focusRect skin is modified. This   means that the
                     changes you make will be applied to the visual focus   indication of _every_ focusable
                     component. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <ol>
                     
                     <li> Drag the components you want to style to the stage. This will   ensure the appropriate
                        component related skins are added to the movie's   library. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> Open the Library panel, and navigate to the "Component Assets   &gt; Shared" folder.
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> Open the focusRectSkin MovieClip for editing by double   clicking on it. </li>
                     
                     <li> Edit the visual border in the skin's MovieClip. For example,   the focus rectangle
                        can be made thicker to stand out more. 
                     </li>
                     
                  </ol>
                  
                  <div class="note">
                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <div>
                        
                        <p>With this approach you will override the existing skin. If   you don't want this,
                           follow the "Duplicate Existing Skin" approach   instead. 
                        </p>
                        
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            <p>The focusRect skin applies to all focusable Flash components. If you   want to modify
               other highlights (for example highlights that occur when   hovering over a component
               with the mouse), you will have to edit   component specific skins individually. For
               example, to edit the   mouseover highlights for the checkbox component, you will have
               to modify   or duplicate both Checkbox_overIcon and Checkbox_selectedOverIcon.   Similarly,
               for the Button component you will have to modify the   Button_over skin. 
            </p>
            <p>Also, keep in mind that the existing skins are automatically   applied on certain
               events (focus, mouseover, etc.). It is however also   possible to manually switch
               a skin at a moment of your own choosing   (e.g. to indicate invalid content for a
               text field). this can also be   achieved this by calling the setStyle method.

               <h3>Example 1: A thick blue border to indicate focus</h3>
               <p>The code below shows an example where form component instances are   associated with
                  a modified version of the focusRectSkin MovieClip. The   result is that the components
                  receive a thick blue border rather than   the default thin border Flash provides.
                  The code makes a reference to a   modified skin called Focus_custom, which has been
                  added to   the movie's library in advance. 
               </p>
               <p>Note that the custom version of focusRectSkin also sets a   transparent yellow background
                  to increase the visual highlight further.   Components such as Buttons and checkboxes
                  will show this background, but   TextInput components will not. To ensure the yellow
                  background will   still be applied to the TextInput instance, the following workaround
                  is   applied: 
               </p>
               <ol>
                  
                  <li> A duplicate version of the TextInput "normal" skin (which can   be found in the library
                     at "Component Asssets &gt; TextInputSkins &gt;   TextInput_upSkin") is created and edited
                     to show a yellow background. 
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> FocusIn, FocusOut, MouseOver and MouseOut handlers are   assigned to the TextInput
                     instance, which temporarily swap the default   "normal" skin with the custom "normal"
                     skin while the component is   focused or hovered over. 
                  </li>
                  
               </ol>
               <p>Additionally, the button_over skin is duplicated and modified to   change the default
                  mouseover highlights for the button component   instance. The checkbox_overIcon and
                  checkbox_selectedOverIcon skins are   directly modified, which means those changes
                  will be applied to all   checkbox instances.
