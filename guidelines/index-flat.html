         <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations
            for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content
            more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations
            for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech
            disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation
            for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user
            need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of
            web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines
            will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.
         </p>
         	
         <p>WCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific.
            Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as
            general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate
            documents. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a> for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.

         <p>WCAG 2.1 extends <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[!WCAG20]], which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that
            conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. The WG intends that for policies requiring
            conformance to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The
            publication of WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. While WCAG 2.0 remains
            a W3C Recommendation, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.1 to maximize future applicability
            of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version
            of WCAG when developing or updating Web accessibility policies.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         			
         <section>
            				
            <h3>Background on WCAG 2</h3>
            				
            <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 defines how to make Web content more
               accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities,
               including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological
               disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not
               able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability.
               These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing
               abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.
            </p>
            				
            <p>WCAG 2.1 is developed through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/">W3C process</a> in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of
               providing a shared standard for Web content accessibility that meets the needs of
               individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.1 builds on WCAG
               2.0 [[!WCAG20]], which in turn built on WCAG 1.0 [[WAI-WEBCONTENT]] and is designed
               to apply broadly to different Web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable
               with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction
               to WCAG, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a>.
            </p>
            
            				
            <p>Significant challenges were encountered in defining additional criteria to address
               cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, including a short timeline for development
               as well as challenges in reaching consensus on testability, implementability, and
               international considerations of proposals. Work will carry on in this area in future
               versions of WCAG. We encourage authors to refer to our supplemental guidance on <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement">improving inclusion for people with disabilities, including learning and cognitive
                  disabilities, people with low-vision, and more</a>.
            </p>
            
            				
            <p>Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible Web
               browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in Web
               accessibility. For an overview of how these components of Web development and interaction
               work together, see:

            <h3>WCAG 2 Layers of Guidance</h3>
            				
            <p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include Web designers
               and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order
               to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided
               including overall <em>principles</em>, general <em>guidelines</em>, testable <em>success criteria</em> and a rich collection of <em>sufficient techniques</em>, <em>advisory techniques</em>, and <em>documented common failures</em> with examples, resource links and code.
            </p>
            				
            <ul>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p><strong>Principles</strong> - At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for Web accessibility:
                     <em>perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust</em>. See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility">Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility</a>.
                  </p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p><strong>Guidelines</strong> - Under the principles are guidelines. The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals
                     that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users
                     with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework
                     and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better
                     implement the techniques.
                  </p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p><strong>Success Criteria</strong> - For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.2 to
                     be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design
                     specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet
                     the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance
                     are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). Additional information on WCAG levels
                     can be found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels">Understanding Levels of Conformance</a>.
                  </p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p><strong>Sufficient and Advisory Techniques</strong> - For each of the <em>guidelines</em> and <em>success criteria</em> in the WCAG 2.1 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety
                     of <em>techniques</em>. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are <em>sufficient</em> for meeting the success criteria and those that are <em>advisory</em>. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria
                     and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address
                     accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where
                     common failures are known, these are also documented. See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques">Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.1</a>.
                  </p>
                  					
               </li>
               				
            </ul>
            				
            <p>All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient
               and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content
               more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are
               able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of
               the widest possible range of users.
            </p>
            				
            <p>Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible
               to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly
               in the cognitive language and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the
               full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, as well as to seek relevant
               advice about current best practice to ensure that Web content is accessible, as far
               as possible, to this community. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-metadata">Metadata</a> may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs.

            <p>The WCAG 2.1 document is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable
               technical standard. Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on the
               WCAG 2.1 document and address other important purposes, including the ability to be
               updated to describe how WCAG would be applied with new technologies. Supporting documents

            <h3>Requirements for WCAG 2.1</h3>
            
            <p>WCAG 2.1 meets a set of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/requirements/">requirements for WCAG 2.1</a> which, in turn, inherit requirements from WCAG 2.0. Requirements structure the overall
               framework of guidelines and ensure backwards compatibility. The Working Group also
               used a less formal set of acceptance criteria for success criteria, to help ensure
               success criteria are similar in style and quality to those in WCAG 2.0. These requirements
               constrained what could be included in WCAG 2.1. This constraint was important to preserve
               its nature as a dot-release of WCAG 2.

            <h3>Comparison with WCAG 2.0</h3>
            
            <p>WCAG 2.1 was initiated with the goal to improve accessibility guidance for three major
               groups: users with cognitive or learning disabilities, users with low vision, and
               users with disabilities on mobile devices. Many ways to meet these needs were proposed
               and evaluated, and a set of these were refined by the Working Group. Structural requirements
               inherited from WCAG 2.0, clarity and impact of proposals, and timeline led to the
               final set of success criteria included in this version. The Working Group considers
               that WCAG 2.1 incrementally advances web content accessibility guidance for all these
               areas, but underscores that not all user needs are met by these guidelines.
            </p>
            
            				
            <p>WCAG 2.1 builds on and is backwards compatible with WCAG 2.0, meaning web pages that
               conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0. Authors that are required by policy
               to conform with WCAG 2.0 will be able to update content to WCAG 2.1 without losing
               conformance with WCAG 2.0. Authors following both sets of guidelines should be aware
               of the following differences:
            </p>
            				
            <section>
               					
               <h4>New Features in WCAG 2.1</h4>
               					
               <p>WCAG 2.1 extends WCAG 2.0 by adding new success criteria, definitions to support them,
                  guidelines to organize the additions, and a couple additions to the conformance section.
                  This additive approach helps to make it clear that sites which conform to WCAG 2.1
                  also conform to WCAG 2.0, thereby meeting conformance obligations that are specific
                  to WCAG 2.0. The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group recommends that sites adopt
                  WCAG 2.1 as their new conformance target, even if formal obligations mention WCAG
                  2.0, to provide improved accessibility and to anticipate future policy changes.
               </p>
               					
               <p>The following Success Criteria are new in WCAG 2.1:</p>

               <h4>Numbering in WCAG 2.1</h4>
               					
               <p>In order to avoid confusion for implementers for whom backwards compatibility to WCAG
                  2.0 is important, new success criteria in WCAG 2.1 have been appended to the end of
                  the set of success criteria within their guideline. This avoids the need to change
                  the section number of success criteria from WCAG 2.0, which would be caused by inserting
                  new success criteria between existing success criteria in the guideline, but it means
                  success criteria in each guideline are no longer grouped by conformance level. The
                  order of success criteria within each guideline does not imply information about conformance
                  level; only the conformance level indicator (A / AA / AAA) on the success criterion
                  itself indicates this. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/">WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference</a> provides ways to view success criteria grouped by conformance level, along with many
                  other filter and sort options.

               <p>WCAG 2.1 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0 with a couple additions, which
                  is described in the <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a> section. It is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG
                  2.0, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0,
                  while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web.

            <h3>Later Versions of Accessibility Guidelines</h3>
            		
            <p>In parallel with WCAG 2.1, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is developing
               another major version of accessibility guidelines. The result of this work is expected
               to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be
               realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The work follows a research-focused, user-centered
               design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the
               roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is
               a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.1 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated
               web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of
               WCAG 2.0. The Working Group might also develop additional interim versions, continuing
               with WCAG 2.2, on a similar short timeline to provide additional support while the
               major version is completed.

Finally, it describes what it means to be <a>accessibility supported</a>, since only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies can be <a>relied upon</a> for conformance. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance">Understanding Conformance</a> includes further explanation of the accessibility-supported concept.

            <p>The main content of WCAG 2.1 is <a>normative</a> and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices,
               sections marked as "non-normative", diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret
               the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.
            </p>
            		
            <p>The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, NOT RECOMMENDED, RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, and SHOULD
               NOT are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119]].

            <h2>Statement of Partial Conformance - Third Party Content</h2>
            
            <p>Sometimes, Web pages are created that will later have additional content added to
               them. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments,
               or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page,
               such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors,
               or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when
               advertisements are inserted dynamically.
            </p>
            
            <p>In these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the
               uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled
               content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options
               are available:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <p>A determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this
                     type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into
                     conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance
                     can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected
                     or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if
                     it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;
                  </p>

   <p class="note">The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive
      technologies there must be for a particular use of a Web technology in order for it
      to be classified as accessibility supported. (See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#support-level">Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"</a>.)

   <p class="note">Web technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long

   <p class="note">When a <a>Web Technology</a> is used in a way that is "accessibility supported," it does not imply that the entire
      technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including
      HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if
      the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to
      meet WCAG requirements.

   <p class="note">When citing Web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported
      should be specified.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">One way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported
      would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported.
      (See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#documented-lists">Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses</a>.) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported
      ways of using Web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in
      the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web
      content technologies above.

   <p class="note">functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations

   <p class="note">Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents
      by using and monitoring APIs.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
      Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
      The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
      that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
      target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
      provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
      of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
      to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
      markup into identifiable bundles.

         of rendered text and images;
      </li>
      
      <li>screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information
         through synthesized speech or braille;
      </li>
      
      <li>text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and
         learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
      </li>
      
      <li>speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;</li>

   <p class="note">Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).</p>
   
   <p class="note">Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered
      (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be
      evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect
      to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no
      background color is specified, then white is assumed.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Background color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered
      in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text
      color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot
      be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text
      color is specified when a background color is specified.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be
      used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border
      around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that
      fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.

   <p class="note">WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that

   </p>
   
   <ol>
      
      <li>there are no more than three <strong>general flashes</strong> and / or no more than three <strong>red flashes</strong> within any one-second period; or
      </li>
      
      <li>the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total
         of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10
         degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance
      </li>
      
   </ol>
   
   <p>where:</p>
   
   <ul>
      
      <li>A <strong>general flash</strong> is defined as a pair of opposing changes in <a>relative luminance</a> of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance where the relative luminance of
         the darker image is below 0.80; and where "a pair of opposing changes" is an increase
         followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and
      </li>
      
      <li>A <strong>red flash</strong> is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red
      </li>
      
   </ul>
   
   <p><em>Exception:</em> Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating
      checkerboard pattern with "squares" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical
      viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">For general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on
      the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide
      a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing
      distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). (Higher resolutions displays
      showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is
      lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.)
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for
      red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or
      relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists
      of two opposing transitions.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">The current working definition in the field for <strong>"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red"</strong> is where, for either or both states involved in each transition, R/(R+ G + B) &gt;=
      0.8, and the change in the value of (R-G-B)x320 is &gt; 20 (negative values of (R-G-B)x320
      are set to zero) for both transitions. R, G, B values range from 0-1 as specified
      in “relative luminance” definition. [[HARDING-BINNIE]]
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Tools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However,
      no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal
      to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above).

   <p>with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size
      for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Fonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that
      reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower
      contrast levels.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing
      that may be done by a user.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined
      size and the user's display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text
      fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150%
      of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors
      would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in
      relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display.
      The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font
      metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who
      have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major
      browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If
      a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would
      be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from
      the default sizes in a similar fashion.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large
      print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK
      languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those
      languages and the next larger standard large print size.
