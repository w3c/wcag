    <p>When a <a>user interface component</a> has keyboard focus, the <a>focus indicator</a>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a>Encloses</a> the visual presentation of the user interface component;</li>
        <li>Has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between its pixels in the focused and unfocused states;</li>
        <li>Has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exceptions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The focus indicator is determined by the user-agent and cannot be adjusted by the author, or</li>
        <li>The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author, or</li>
        <li>An area of the focus indicator meets all the following:
            <ul>
                <li>At least as large as the area of a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> thick <a>perimeter</a> of the unfocused component, or is at least as large as a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of the <a>minimum bounding box</a> of the unfocused component, and</li>
                <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against the same pixels in the unfocused state, and </li>
                <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent non-focus-indicator colors, or is no thinner than 2 CSS pixels.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
                
    <p>Where a user interface component has active sub-components, if a sub-component receives a focus indicator, these requirements can be applied to the sub-component instead.</p>

    <p class="note">Note: Examples of sub-components that may receive a focus indicator are menu items in an opened drop-down menu. However, it may also be possible to indicate user interaction for such sub-components by relying strictly on a visual indication of which item is <em>selected</em>. Where selectable sub-components have no differentiated focus indicator, the visual indicator for sub-component selection is measured against <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a> requirements, not against this Criterion.</p>
    <p class="note">Note: Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined within the technology (such as HTML, CSS and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent resolution enhancements and anti-aliasing can be ignored.</p>
