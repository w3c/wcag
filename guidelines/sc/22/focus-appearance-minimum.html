    <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>

    <p>When a <a>user interface component</a> has keyboard focus, the focus indicator:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a>Encompasses</a> the visual presentation of the user interface component;</li>
        <li>Has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between its pixels in the focused and unfocused states;</li>
        <li>Has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exceptions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The focus indicator is determined by the user-agent and cannot be adjusted by the author, or</li>
        <li>The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author, or</li>
        <li>An area of the focus indicator meets all the following:
            <ul>
                <li>At least as large as the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component, or is at least as large as a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of a minimum bounding box of the unfocused component, and</li>
                <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against the same pixels in the unfocused state, and </li>
                <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against the component, or is no thinner than 2 CSS pixels.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Where a user interface component has active sub-components (for example, an opened drop-down menu shows a list of menu items), the above requirements apply to the indicator of the active sub-component.</p>
