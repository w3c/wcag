    <p>For the keyboard focus indicator of each User Interface Component, all of the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a>focus indication area</a> is greater than or equal to a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> border of the focused control, or has a thickness of at least 8 CSS pixels along the shortest side of the element.</li>
        <li><strong>Change of contrast:</strong> The color change for the focus indication area has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the colors of the unfocused state.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> The focus indication area has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against all adjacent colors for the minimum area or greater, or has a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.</li>
        <li><strong>Not fully obscured:</strong> The item with focus is not entirely hidden by author-created content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
    <p class="note">If the control has a visible boundary smaller than the hit area, the size measure is taken from the visible boundary.</p>
    <p class="ednote">The working group is interested in feedback about the minimum area metric, and if there are unusual scenarios where visible indicators are caught by the wording.</p>
