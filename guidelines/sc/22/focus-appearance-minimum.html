    <p>When <a>user interface components</a> receive keyboard focus, all of the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrasting area:</strong>  There is an area of the <a>focus indicator</a> that has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the colors in the focused and unfocused states.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The contrasting area is at least as large as:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outline:</strong> the area of a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> thick <a>perimeter</a> of the unfocused component, or</li>
                <li><strong>Shape:</strong> the area of a 4 CSS pixel line along the shortest side of a <a>minimum bounding box</a> of the unfocused component, and no thinner than 2 CSS pixels.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> The contrasting area also has a contrast ratio of least 3:1 against adjacent colors in the focused component, or the contrasting area has a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.</li>
        <li><strong>Not fully obscured:</strong> The item with focus is not entirely hidden by author-created content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
    <p class="note">If the component has a visible boundary smaller than the hit area, or the size of the component is not available, the minimum area can be taken from the visible boundary.</p>
    <p class="ednote">The working group is interested in feedback about the minimum area metric, and if there are unusual scenarios where visible indicators are caught by the wording.</p>
