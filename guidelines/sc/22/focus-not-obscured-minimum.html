    <p>When a <a>user interface component</a> receives keyboard focus, the component is not entirely hidden due to author-created content.</p>

    <p class="note">Where content in a configurable interface can be repositioned by the user, then only the initial positions of user-movable content is considered for testing and conformance of this Success Criterion.</p>

    <p class="note">Content opened by the <em>user</em> may obscure the component receiving focus. If the user can reveal the focused component without advancing the keyboard focus, the component with focus is not considered hidden due to author-created content.</p>
