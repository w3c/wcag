    <p><a>Targets</a> have an area of at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, except where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> The <a>target offset</a> is at least 24 CSS pixels to every adjacent target;</li>
        <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The target is in a sentence or block of text;</li>
        <li><strong>Essential:</strong> A particular presentation of the target is <a>essential</a> or is legally required for the information being conveyed;</li>
        <li><strong>User agent control:</strong> The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;</li>
        <li><strong>Equivalent:</strong> The function can be achieved through an equivalent control that has an area of at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Targets that allow for values to be selected spatially based on position within the target are considered one target for the purpose of the success criterion. Examples include sliders with granular values, color pickers displaying a gradient of colors, or editable areas where you position the cursor.</p>
    <p class="ednote">Are there issues with internationalization when describing inline links?</p>
    <p class="ednote">Are there issues with pop-over content overlapping targets triggering failures?</p>
