    <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
	<p class="change">New</p>
    
    <p>The size of the <a>target</a> for <a>pointer inputs</a> is at least 24 by 24 <a>CSS pixels</a>, except where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> There is at least one point in a target that is at least 12 CSS pixels from the closest edge of all other targets simultaneously;</li>
        <li><strong>Equivalent:</strong> The function can be achieved through a different control on the same page that meets this criterion;</li>
        <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The target is in a sentence or block of text;</li>
        <li><strong>User agent control:</strong> The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;</li>
        <li><strong>Essential:</strong> A particular presentation of the target is <a>essential</a> or is legally required for the information being conveyed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Targets that allow for values to be selected spatially based on position within the target are considered one target for the purpose of the success criterion. Examples include sliders with granular values, color pickers displaying a gradient of colors, or editable areas where you position the cursor.</p>
