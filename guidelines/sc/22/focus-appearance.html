    <h4>Focus Appearance</h4>

    <p class="conformance-level">AAA</p>
	<p class="change">New</p>

    <p>When the keyboard <a>focus indicator</a> is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>is at least as large as the area of a 2 <a>CSS pixel</a> thick <a>perimeter</a> of the unfocused component or sub-component, and</li>
        <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Exceptions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The focus indicator is determined by the <a>user agent</a> and cannot be adjusted by the author, or</li>
        <li>The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">What is perceived as the user interface component or sub-component (to determine the perimeter) depends on its visual <a>presentation</a>. The visual presentation includes the component's visible <a>content</a>, border, and component-specific background. It does not include shadow and glow effects outside the component's content, background, or border.</p>

    <p class="note">Examples of sub-components that may receive a focus indicator are menu items in an opened drop-down menu, or focusable cells in a grid.</p>

    <p class="note">Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined within the <a>technology</a> (such as HTML, CSS, and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent resolution enhancements and anti-aliasing can be ignored.</p>
