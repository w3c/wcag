    <p>A <a>cognitive function test</a> (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless that step provides at least one of the following:</p> 
    <dl>
        <dt>Alternative</dt>
        <dd>Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.</dd>
        <dt>Mechanism</dt>
        <dd>A mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</dd>
        <dt>Recognize Objects</dt>
        <dd>The cognitive function test is to recognize objects.</dd>
        <dt>Identify Own Content</dt>
        <dd>The cognitive function test is to identify non-text content the user provided to the website.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">Objects and content for the exception may be represented by images, video, or audio.</p>
    <div class="note">Examples of mechanisms that satisfy this criterion include:
        <ol>
            <li>support for password entry by password managers to reduce memory need, and</li>
            <li>copy and paste to reduce the cognitive burden of re-typing.</li>
        </ol>
