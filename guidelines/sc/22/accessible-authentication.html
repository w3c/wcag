    <p>For each step in an authentication process that relies on a <a>cognitive function test</a> such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle, at least one other authentication method is available that does not rely on a cognitive function test, or a mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</p>
    <p>Exception: When the cognitive function test is to recognize objects, or content the user provided to the website.</p>
    <p class="note">Objects and content for the exception may be represented by images, text, video or audio.</p>
    <p class="note">Examples of mechanisms include: 1) support for password entry by password managers to address the memorization cognitive function test, and 2) copy and paste to help address the transcription cognitive function test.</p>
