  <p>All <a>functionality</a> that uses a <a>dragging movement</a> for operation can be achieved by a <a>single pointer</a> without dragging, unless dragging is <a>essential</a> or the functionality is determined by the <a>user agent</a> and not modified by the author.</p>
    <p class="note">This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e., this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).</p>
