    <h4>Dragging Movements</h4>

    <p>All functionality that uses a <a>dragging movement</a> for operation can be achieved by a <a>single pointer</a> without dragging, unless dragging is <a>essential</a> or the functionality is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.</p>
    <p class="note">This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).</p>
    <p class="ednote">Is there an assistive technology that helps for people with mobility impairments? The group would like feedback on the frontier between AT &amp; author responsibility.</p>
