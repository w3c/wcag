  <p>Where <a>user interface components</a> become visible as a result of pointer hover or keyboard focus, information needed to identify that such components are available is provided visually, except when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The information needed to identify the user interface components is available through an equivalent component that is visible on the same page or on a different step in a multi-step process without requiring pointer hover or keyboard focus;</li>
        <li>The component is provided specifically to enhance the experience for keyboard navigation;</li>
        <li>A mechanism is available to make the information persistently visible;</li>
        <li>Hiding the information needed to identify the component is essential.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">User interface components can be available through other visible components such as sub-menus, edit buttons, tabs, or thumbnails of media.</p>
    <p class="ednote">The working group is interested in feedback about whether there are Components determined by the user agent that should not be in scope.</p>
