    <p>Information needed to identify user interface components is visible without requiring pointer hover or keyboard focus, except when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hiding the information needed to identify the control is essential;</li>
        <li>The control is provided specifically to enhance the experience for keyboard navigation;</li>
        <li>The information needed to identify the user interface components is available through an equivalent control that is visible on the same page or on a different step in a multi-step process without requiring pointer hover or keyboard focus;</li>
        <li>A mechanism is available to make the information persistently visible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Controls can be available through a visible entry point such as a sub-menu.</p>
    <p class="ednote">The working group is interested in feedback about whether there are controls determined by the user agent that should not be in scope.</p>
