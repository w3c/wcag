   <p>In content implemented using markup languages that support the following <a>text</a> <a>style properties</a>, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:</p>
   
   <ul>
     <li>Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;</li>
