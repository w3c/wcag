   <h4>Adapting Text</h4>

   <p>If the technologies being used allow the <a>user agent</a> to <a>adapt</a> <a>style properties</a> of <a>text</a>, then no loss of <a>essential</a> content or functionality occurs by adapting all of the following:</p>
   
   <ol>
     <li>line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size</li>
     <li>spacing underneath paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size</li>
     <li>letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size<a></a></li>
     <li>word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size</li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>Note: Examples of text that are typically not affected by <a>style properties</a> are open <a>captions</a> and <a>images of text</a>, which are not expected to adapt.</p>
  
   <p class="ednote">The Working Group seeks to include overriding text color, background color, and font-family as part of this SC, but is not yet able to identify a way to do so that is sufficiently testable.</p>
