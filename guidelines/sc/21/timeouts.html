   <p>Where data can be lost due to user inactivity, users are warned at the start of a process about the length of inactivity that generates the timeout, unless the data is preserved for a minimum of 24 hours of user inactivity.</p>

<p class="note">Privacy regulations may require explicit user consent before user identification has been authenticated and before user data is preserved. In cases where the user is a minor, explicit consent may not be solicited in most jurisdictions. Consultation with privacy professionals and legal counsel is advised when considering data preservation as an approach to satisfy this success criterion.</p>
