   <p class="issue">This is a proposed Success Criterion that has not yet been formally approved by the
      Working Group. Discussion of the issue is available in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/65">Issue 65</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/pull/111">Pull Request 111</a>.

   <p>For single-pointer activation, at least one of the following is true:</p>
   					
   <ul>
      						
      <li>Activation is on the up event, either explicitly or implicitly as a platform's generic
         activation/click event;
      </li>
      						
      <li>A mechanism is available that allows the user to choose the up-event as an option;</li>
      						
      <li>Confirmation is provided, which can dismiss activation;</li>
      						
      <li>Activation is reversible;</li>
      						
      <li>The down-event activation event is essential to the activity and waiting for the up-event would invalidate the activity. 
      </li>
      					
   </ul>
   					
   <p class="note">(Note just for WG during review and won't be partof the SC - This success criteria applies when platform assistive technology (e.g. screen reader)
      that remaps touch gestures is not turned on - see proposed SC Touch with Assistive
      Technology.)
