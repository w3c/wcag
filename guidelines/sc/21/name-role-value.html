   <p>For all <a>user interface components</a> (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts),
      the <a>name</a> and <a>role</a> can be <a>programmatically determined</a>; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be <a>programmatically set</a>; and notification of changes to these items is available to <a>user agents</a>, including <a>assistive technologies</a>.

   <p class="note">This success criterion is primarily for Web authors who develop or script their own
      user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success
      criterion when used according to specification.
