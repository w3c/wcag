  <p><a>Essential</a> visual identifiers of <a>user interface components</a> have a <a>contrast ratio</a> of at least 4.5:1 against the immediate surrounding color(s), except for the following situations:
   </p>
   					
   <dl>
   	<dt>Thicker</dt> 						
     <dd>A contrast ratio of at least 3:1 is required where the minimum width and height are at least
       3 <a>CSS pixels</a>, for the essential visual identifier;
      </dd>
   	<dt>Inactive</dt> 					
     <dd>Disabled or otherwise inactive user interface components;
     </dd>
   	<dt>User Agent Control</dt>
     <dd> The color(s) of the user interface component and any adjacent color(s) are determined by the user agent and are not modified by the author.
     </dd>
      					
   </dl>
	<p class="note">Examples of essential visual identifiers of user interface components may include (a border, edge, or icon), current value (such as non-text visual indication of aria-valuenow on a slider) and current state (such as selection indicator, focus indicator) or other essential visual indication (which do not rely on color alone).</p>

   <ul>
   	<li>Under consideration: simplify this Success Criterion by setting the minimum color contrast requirement to 3:1 and removing any need for measuring thickness.</li>
    <li>Under consideration: will review to see if it is possible to combine with proposed WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.11 Graphics Contrast.</li>
