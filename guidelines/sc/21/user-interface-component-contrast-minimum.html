  <p>The visual presentation of all <a>essential</a> graphical objects for <a>user interface components</a> has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the immediate surrounding color(s), except for the situations listed below
   </p>
   					
   <ul>
      						
      <li><strong>Thicker:</strong> A contrast ratio of 3:1 is required where the minimum width and height are at least
         3 <a>CSS pixels</a>, for either the graphical object or (one of) their border line(s).
      </li>
      						
      <li><strong>Inactive:</strong> Disabled or otherwise inactive user interface components are exempt from this requirement.
         In all other states (including when the page is scrolled) the contrast requirement
         is applicable.
