   <h4>Pointer Cancellation</h4>
   					
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   					
   <p>For <a>functionality</a> that can be operated using a <a>single pointer</a>, at least one of the following is true:</p>
   					
   <dl>
   
   <dt>No Down-Event</dt>
     <dd>The <a>down-event</a> of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;</dd>
      						
   <dt>Abort or Undo</dt>
     <dd>Completion of the function is on the <a>up-event</a>, and a <a>mechanism</a> is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;</dd>
      						
   <dt>Up Reversal</dt>
     <dd>The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;</dd>
      						
   <dt>Essential</dt>
     <dd>Completing the function on the down-event is <a>essential</a>.</dd>
      						
   </dl>
   <p class="note">Functions that emulate a keyboard or numeric keypad key press are considered essential.</p>
   					
  <p class="note">This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e., this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).</p>
