   <h4>Label in Name</h4>
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
	
  <p>For <a>user interface components</a> with <a>labels</a> that include <a>text</a> or <a>images of text</a>, the <a>name</a> contains the text that is presented visually.</p>

  <p class="note">A best practice is to have  the text of the label at the start of the name.</p>
