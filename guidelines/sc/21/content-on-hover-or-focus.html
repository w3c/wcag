    	<p>When pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible, the following are true:</p>

  <dl>

    <dt>Dismissable</dt>
    <dd>A <a>mechanism</a> is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an <a>input error</a> or does not obscure other content;</dd>

    <dt>Hoverable</dt>
   <dd>If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved to hover the additional content;</dd>

    <dt>Persistent</dt>
    <dd>The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.</dd>

  </dl>
    	
    	<p>Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.</p>

    	<p class="note">Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-title-attribute"><code>title</code> attribute</a>.</p>
     <p class="note">Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups which display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.</p>
