   <h4>Pointer Gestures</h4>
   					
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   					
   <p>All <a>functionality</a> that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a <a>single pointer</a> without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is <a>essential</a>.</p>
   					
   <p class="note">This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e., this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).</p>
