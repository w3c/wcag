   <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
   					
  <p>Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is <a>essential</a>.</p>
   				
   <p class="note">Examples where a particular display orientation may be essential are a bank check, a piano application, slides for a projector or television, or virtual reality content where parts of the image (for instance, a status bar or heads-up display) always remain at a fixed orientation relative to the headset screens (and the user's eyes) regardless of the physical orientation of the headset.</p>
