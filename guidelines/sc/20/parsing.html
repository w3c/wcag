   <p>In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end
      tags, elements are nested according to the syntactical rules of their specifications, elements do not contain
      duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow
      these features.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such
      as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not
      complete.
