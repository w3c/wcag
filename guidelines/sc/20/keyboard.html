   <h4>Keyboard</h4>
   
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   
   <p>All <a>functionality</a> of the content is operable through a <a>keyboard interface</a> without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying
      function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just
      the endpoints.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example,
      if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent
      input but the underlying function (text input) does not.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input
      methods in addition to keyboard operation.
