   <h4>Pause, Stop, Hide</h4>

   <p>For moving, <a>blinking</a>, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:
   </p>
   
   <dl>
      
      <dt>Moving, blinking, scrolling</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2)
            lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content,
            there is a mechanism for the user to <a>pause</a>, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity
            where it is <a>essential</a>; and
         </p>
         
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Auto-updating</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented
            in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop,
            or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part
            of an activity where it is essential.
         </p>
         
      </dd>
      
   </dl>
   
   <p class="note">For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to <a href="#seizures-and-physical-reactions">Guideline 2.3</a>.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to
      meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See <a href="#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference</a>.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent
      is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between
      the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically
      possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered
      essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating
      progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.
