   <h4>Audio Control</h4>
   
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   
   <p>If any audio on a web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a <a>mechanism</a> is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio
      volume independently from the overall system volume level.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether or not it is used
      to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See <a href="#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference</a>.
