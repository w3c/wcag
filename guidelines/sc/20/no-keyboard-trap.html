   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   
   <p>If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a <a>keyboard interface</a>, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface,
      and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit
      methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to
      meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See <a href="#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference</a>.
