   <h4>Visual Presentation</h4>
   
   <p class="conformance-level">AAA</p>
   
   <p>For the visual presentation of <a>blocks of text</a>, a <a>mechanism</a> is available to achieve the following:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Foreground and background colors can be selected by the user.</li>   
     <li>Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK).</li>   
     <li>Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins).</li>   
     <li>Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.</li>   
     <li>Text can be resized without <a>assistive technology</a> up to 200 percent in a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text <a>on a full-screen window</a>.</li>   
  </ul>

<p class="note">Content is not required to use these values. The requirement is that a mechanism is available for users to change these presentation aspects. The mechanism can be provided by the browser or other user agent. Content is not required to provide the mechanism.</p>

<p class="note">Writing systems for some languages use different presentation aspects to improve readability and legibility. If a presentation aspect in this success criterion is not used in a writing system, content in that writing system does not need to use that presentation setting and can conform without it. Authors are encouraged to follow guidance for improving readability and legibility of text in their writing system.</p>
