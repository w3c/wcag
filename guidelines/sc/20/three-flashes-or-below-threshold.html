   <h4>Three Flashes or Below Threshold</h4>
   
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   
   <p><a>Web pages</a> do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period,
      or the <a>flash</a> is below the <a>general flash and red flash thresholds</a>.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to
      meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See <a href="#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference</a>.
