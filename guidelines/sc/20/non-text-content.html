   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   
   <p>All <a>non-text content</a> that is presented to the user has a <a>text alternative</a> that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

         <p>If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a <a>name</a> that describes its purpose. (Refer to <a href="#name-role-value">Success Criterion 4.1.2</a> for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)

         <p>If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive
            identification of the non-text content. (Refer to <a href="#time-based-media">Guideline 1.2</a> for additional requirements for media.)

         <p>If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in <a>text</a>, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text
            content.

            content.

         <p>If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by
            a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe
            the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA
            using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate
            different disabilities.
