   <h4>Low or No Background Audio</h4>
   
   <p class="conformance-level">AAA</p>
   
   <p>For <a>prerecorded</a>
      <a>audio-only</a> content that (1) contains primarily speech in the foreground, (2) is not an audio
      <a>CAPTCHA</a> or audio logo, and (3) is not vocalization intended to be primarily musical expression
      such as singing or rapping, at least one of the following is true:
   </p>
   
   <dl>
      
      <dt>No Background</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>The audio does not contain background sounds.</p>
         
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Turn Off</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>The background sounds can be turned off.</p>
         
      </dd>
      
      <dt>20 dB</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>The background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground speech content,
            with the exception of occasional sounds that last for only one or two seconds.
         </p>
         
         <p class="note">Per the definition of "decibel," background sound that meets this requirement will
            be approximately four times quieter than the foreground speech content.
         </p>
