   <h4>Timing Adjustable</h4>
   
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   
   <p>For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:</p>
   
   <dl>
      
      <dt>Turn off</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or</p>
         
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Adjust</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range
            that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
         </p>
         
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Extend</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the
            time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user
            is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
         </p>
         
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Real-time Exception</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
        <p>The time limit is a required part of a <a>real-time event</a> (for example, an auction),
            and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
         </p>
         
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Essential Exception</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>The time limit is <a>essential</a> and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
         </p>
         
      </dd>
      
      <dt>20 Hour Exception</dt>
      
      <dd>
         
         <p>The time limit is longer than 20 hours.</p>
         
      </dd>
      
   </dl>
   
   <p class="note">This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected
      changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion
      should be considered in conjunction with <a href="#on-focus">Success Criterion 3.2.1</a>, which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.
