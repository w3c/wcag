   <p>the continuous line forming the boundary of a shape, not including shared pixels. For example, the perimeter calculation for a rectangle is 2<em>h</em>+2<em>w</em> -4, where <em>h</em> is the height and <em>w</em> is the width and the corners are not counted twice. The perimeter of a circle is 2𝜋<em>r</em>.</p>
