   <p>The point where the user’s input interacts with the web page. For example, tabbing through a page with a keyboard moves the focus. Clicking or tapping on the page would move the focus for mouse and touchscreen usage. Different inputs can be used by a user, but at any one time there would be one point of focus for the user with the last input used.
