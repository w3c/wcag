<dd>
   <p>an input modality that only targets a single point on the page/screen at a time â€“ such as a mouse, single finger on a touch screen, or stylus.</p>
   <p class="note">Single pointer interactions include clicks, double clicks, taps, dragging motions, and single-finger swipe gestures. In contrast, multipoint interactions involve the use of two or more pointers at the same time, such as two-finger interactions on a touchscreen, or the simultaneous use of a mouse and stylus.</p>
