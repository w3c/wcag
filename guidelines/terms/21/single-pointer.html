<dd>
   <p>an input that only targets a single point on the page/screen at a time – such as a mouse, single finger on a touch screen, or stylus.</p>
   <p class="note">In contrast to single pointer inputs, multipoint interactions involve the use of two or more pointers at the same time – such as two finger interactions on a touchscreen, or the simultaneous use of a mouse and stylus.</p>
