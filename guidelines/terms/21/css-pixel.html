   <p>A CSS pixel is the canonical unit of measure for all lengths and measurements in CSS.
      This unit is density-independent, and distinct from actual hardware pixels present
      in a display. User agents and operating systems should ensure that a CSS pixel is
      set as closely as possible to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#reference-pixel">CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 reference pixel</a> [[css3-values]], which takes into account the physical dimensions of the display
      and the assumed viewing distance (factors that cannot be determined by content authors).
