   <p>One point of contact with the screen (vs. multi-touch). A pointer can be any point of contact on the screen made by a mouse cursor, pen, touch (including multi-touch), or other pointing input device. This model makes it easier to write sites and applications that work well no matter what hardware the user has. For scenarios when device-specific handling is desired, this specification also defines properties for inspecting. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/">Pointer Events (REC)</a><a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/">Pointer Events Level 2 (ED)</a>
