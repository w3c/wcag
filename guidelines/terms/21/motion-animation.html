<dd>
   <p>addition of steps between conditions to create the illusion of movement or to give a sense of a smooth transition</p>
	<aside class="example"><p>For example, an element which moves into place or changes size while appearing is considered to be animated. An element which appears or changes instantly, without transition/animation steps, is not using animation.</p><p>Motion animation does not include changes – such as changes of color or opacity – that do not alter the perceived size, shape, position, or distance/depth of the element to the viewer.</p></aside>
