   <p>addition of steps between conditions to create the illusion of movement or to give a sense of a smooth transition</p>
	<aside class="example"><p>For example, an element which moves into place or changes size while appearing is considered to be animated. An element which appears instantly without transitioning is not using animation. Motion animation does not include changes of color, blurring, or opacity which do not change the perceived size, shape, or position of the element.</p></aside>
