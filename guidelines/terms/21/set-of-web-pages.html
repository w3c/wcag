<dt><dfn>set of web pages</dfn></dt>
<dd>
   
   <p>collection of <a>web pages</a> that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization
   </p>
   
   <aside class="example"><p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>a publication which is split across multiple Web pages, where each page contains one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the full set of pages.</li>
      <li>an e-commerce website shows products in a set of Web pages that all share the same navigation and identification. However, when progressing to the checkout process, the template changes; the navigation and other elements are removed, so the pages in that process are functionally and visually different. The checkout pages are not part of the set of product pages.</li>
      <li>a blog on a sub-domain (e.g. blog.example.com) which has a different navigation and is authored by a distinct set of people from the pages on the primary domain (example.com).</li>
   </ul></aside>

  <p class="note">Different language versions would be considered different sets of Web pages.</p>
