<dd>
   
   <p>audio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the <a>video</a> so that there is time to add additional description
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">This technique is only used when the sense of the <a>video</a> would be lost without the additional <a>audio description</a> and the pauses between dialogue/narration are too short.
