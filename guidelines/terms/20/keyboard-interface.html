   <p>interface used by software to obtain keystroke input</p>
   
    <div class="note">
        <p>A keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the
        native technology does not contain a keyboard.</p>

        <p class="example">A touchscreen PDA has a keyboard interface built into its operating system as well
        as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface
        to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications
        that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text
        applications with "keyboard emulation" functionality.</p>
    </div>
   
   <p class="note">Operation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated
      mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard
      interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface,
      not through its keyboard interface.
