<dd>
   
   <p>version that</p>
   
   <ol>
      
      <li>conforms at the designated level, and</li>
      
      <li>provides all of the same information and <a>functionality</a> in the same <a>human language</a>, and
      </li>
      
      <li>is as up to date as the non-conforming content, and</li>
      
      <li>
         <p>for which at least one of the following is true:</p>
         
         <ol>
            
            <li>the conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an <a>accessibility-supported</a>
               <a>mechanism</a>, or
            </li>
            
            <li>the non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version, or</li>
            
            <li>the non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides
               a mechanism to reach the conforming version
            </li>
            
         </ol>
         
      </li>
      
   </ol>
   
   <p class="note">In this definition, "can only be reached" means that there is some mechanism, such
      as a conditional redirect, that prevents a user from "reaching" (loading) the non-conforming
      page unless the user had just come from the conforming version.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">The alternate version does not need to be matched page for page with the original
      (e.g., the conforming alternate version may consist of multiple pages).
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">If multiple language versions are available, then conforming alternate versions are
      required for each language offered.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Alternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments
      or user groups. Each version should be as conformant as possible. One version would
      need to be fully conformant in order to meet <a href="#cc1">conformance requirement 1</a>.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">The conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance,
      or even on the same Web site, as long as it is as freely available as the non-conforming
      version.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Alternate versions should not be confused with <a>supplementary content</a>, which support the original page and enhance comprehension.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Setting user preferences within the content to produce a conforming version is an
      acceptable mechanism for reaching another version as long as the method used to set
      the preferences is accessibility supported.
