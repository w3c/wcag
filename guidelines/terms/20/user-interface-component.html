   <p>a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct
      function
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element.
      "Components" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user
      perceives as separate controls.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated
      by scripts.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes
      called "user interface element".
   </p>
   
   <aside class="example"><p>An applet has a "control" that can be used to move through content by line or page
      or random access. Since each of these would need to have a name and be settable independently,
      they would each be a "user interface component."
