<dd>
   
   <p>synchronized visual and/or <a>text alternative</a> for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Captions are similar to dialogue-only subtitles except captions convey not only the
      content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information
      needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter,
      speaker identification and location.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Closed Captions are equivalents that can be turned on and off with some players.</p>
   
   <p class="note">Open Captions are any captions that cannot be turned off. For example, if the captions
      are visual equivalent <a>images of text</a> embedded in <a>video</a>.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Captions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.</p>
   
   <p class="note">In some countries, captions are called subtitles.</p>
   
   <p class="note"><a>Audio descriptions</a> can be, but do not need to be, captioned since they are descriptions of information
      that is already presented visually.
