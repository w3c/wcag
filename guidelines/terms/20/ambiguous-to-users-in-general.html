   <p>the purpose cannot be determined from the link and all information of the Web page
      presented to the user simultaneously with the link (i.e., readers without disabilities
      would not know what a link would do until they activated it)

   <p class="example">The word guava in the following sentence "One of the notable exports is guava" is
      a link. The link could lead to a definition of guava, a chart listing the quantity
      of guava exported or a photograph of people harvesting guava. Until the link is activated,
      all readers are unsure and the person with a disability is not at any disadvantage.
