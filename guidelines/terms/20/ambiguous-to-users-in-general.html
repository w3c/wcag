   <aside class="example"><p>The word guava in the following sentence "One of the notable exports is guava" is
      a link. The link could lead to a definition of guava, a chart listing the quantity
      of guava exported or a photograph of people harvesting guava. Until the link is activated,
      all readers are unsure and the person with a disability is not at any disadvantage.
