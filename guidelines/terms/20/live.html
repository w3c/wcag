   <p>information captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with
      no more than a broadcast delay
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">A broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order
      to give the broadcaster time to cue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient
      to allow significant editing.
