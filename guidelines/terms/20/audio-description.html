   <p class="note">In the context of audio descriptions, <a>synchronized media</a> predominantly describes audio and video technologies that are combined and played in tandem, which allows an author to align the timing of the audio descriptions in the audio track with the appearance of the relevant visuals in the video. In pre-recorded content, there can be intentionally asynchronous sound or images; however, they will always occur at the same time on each playback of synchronized media.</p>
