   <p>object in which the user agent presents content</p>
   
   <p class="note">The <a>user agent</a> presents content through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames,
      loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport
      (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts,
      menus, and alerts are not viewports.
