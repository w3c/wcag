   <p>major changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view
      the entire page simultaneously
   </p>
   
   <p>Changes in context include changes of:</p>
   
   <ul>
      
      <li><a>user agent</a>;
      </li>
      
      <li><a>viewport</a>;
      </li>
      
      <li>focus;</li>
      
      <li><a>content</a> that changes the meaning of the <a>Web page</a>
      </li>
      
   </ul>
   
   <p class="note">A change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as
      an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the
      context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).
   </p>
   
   <aside class="example"><p>Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including
      anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly
      re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.
