			<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general.</p>
			<p>WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a> for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.</p>
			<p>WCAG 2.0 succeeds <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a> [[WCAG10]], which was published as a W3C Recommendation May 1999. Although it is possible to conform either to WCAG 1.0 or to WCAG 2.0 (or both), the W3C recommends that new and updated content use WCAG 2.0. The W3C also recommends that Web accessibility policies reference WCAG 2.0.</p>

			<h1>Introduction </h1>
			<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.</p>
			<p>WCAG 2.0 is developed through the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process.php">W3C process</a> in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for Web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.0 builds on WCAG 1.0 [[WCAG10]] and is designed to apply broadly to different Web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a>.</p>
			<p>Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible Web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in Web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of Web development and interaction work together, see:</p>

			<section id="intro-layers-guidance">
				<h2>WCAG 2.0 Layers of Guidance</h2>
				<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include Web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall <em>principles</em>, general <em>guidelines</em>, testable <em>success criteria</em> and a rich collection of <em>sufficient techniques, advisory techniques</em>, and <em>documented common failures</em> with examples, resource links and code.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Principles</strong> - At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for Web accessibility: <em>perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust</em>. See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro">Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility</a>.</li>
					<li><strong>Guidelines</strong> - Under the principles are guidelines. The 12 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.</li>
					<li><strong>Success Criteria</strong> - For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.0 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Understanding Levels of Conformance</a>.</li>
					<li><strong>Sufficient and Advisory Techniques</strong> - For each of the <em>guidelines</em> and <em>success criteria</em> in the WCAG 2.0 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of <em>techniques</em>. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are <em>sufficient</em> for meeting the success criteria and those that are <em>advisory</em>. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro">Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.0</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users.</p>
				<p>Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive, language, and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that Web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/understanding-metadata">Metadata</a> may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs.</p>

				<h2> WCAG 2.0 Supporting Documents </h2>
				<p>The WCAG 2.0 document is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical standard. Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on the WCAG 2.0 document and address other important purposes, including the ability to be updated to describe how WCAG would be applied with new technologies. Supporting documents include:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong><a href="/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">How to Meet WCAG 2.0</a></strong> - A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2.0 that includes all of the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques for authors to use as they are developing and evaluating Web content.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding WCAG 2.0</a></strong> - A guide to understanding and implementing WCAG 2.0. There is a short "Understanding" document for each guideline and success criterion in WCAG 2.0 as well as key topics.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2.0</a></strong> - A collection of techniques and common failures, each in a separate document that includes a description, examples, code and tests.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20">The WCAG 2.0 Documents</a></strong> - A diagram and description of how the technical documents are related and linked.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>See <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a> for a description of the WCAG 2.0 supporting material, including education resources related to WCAG 2.0. Additional resources covering topics such as the business case for Web accessibility, planning implementation to improve the accessibility of Web sites, and accessibility policies are listed in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/Overview">WAI Resources</a>.</p>

			<section id="new-terms">
				<h2>Important Terms in WCAG 2.0</h2>
				<p>WCAG 2.0 includes three important terms that are different from WCAG 1.0. Each of these is introduced briefly below and defined more fully in the glossary.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><dfn>Web Page</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>It is important to note that, in this standard, the term " <a>Web page</a>" includes much more than static HTML pages. It also includes the increasingly dynamic Web pages that are emerging on the Web, including "pages" that can present entire virtual interactive communities. For example, the term "Web page" includes an immersive, interactive movie-like experience found at a single URI. For more information, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Understanding "Web Page"</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><dfn>Programmatically Determined</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Several success criteria require that content (or certain aspects of content) can be " <a>programmatically determined</a>." This means that the content is delivered in such a way that <a>user agents</a>, including <a>assistive technologies</a>, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities. For more information, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Understanding Programmatically Determined</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><dfn>Accessibility Supported</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Using a technology in a way that is accessibility supported means that it works with assistive technologies (AT) and the accessibility features of operating systems, browsers, and other user agents. Technology features can only be <a>relied upon</a> to conform to WCAG 2.0 success criteria if they are used in a way that is " <a>accessibility supported</a>". Technology features can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported (do not work with assistive technologies, etc.) as long as they are not relied upon to conform to any success criterion (i.e., the same information or functionality is also available another way that is supported).</p>
						<p>The definition of "accessibility supported" is provided in the <a href="#glossary"></a> section of these guidelines. For more information, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Understanding Accessibility Support</a>.</p>

				<h2>Conformance Requirements</h2>
				<p>In order for a Web page to conform to WCAG 2.0, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:</p>

				<section id="cc1">
					<h3>Conformance Level</h3>
					<p>One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the <a>Web page</a> <a>satisfies</a> all the Level A Success Criteria, or a <a>conforming alternate version</a> is provided.</li>
						<li>For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.</li>
						<li>For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Although conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.</p>
					<p>It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="cc2">
					<h3>Full pages</h3>
					<p><a>Conformance</a> (and conformance level) is for full <a>Web page(s)</a> only, and cannot be achieved if part of a Web page is excluded.</p>
					<p>For the purpose of determining conformance, alternatives to part of a page's content are considered part of the page when the alternatives can be obtained directly from the page, e.g., a long description or an alternative presentation of a video.</p>
					<p>Authors of Web pages that cannot conform due to content outside of the author's control may consider a <a href="#conformance-partial">Statement of Partial Conformance</a>.</p>

				<h2>Statement of Partial Conformance - Third Party Content</h2>
				<p>Sometimes, Web pages are created that will later have additional content added to them. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.</p>
				<p>In these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><p>A determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;</p>
						<p><strong>OR</strong></p></li>
					<li><p>A "statement of partial conformance" may be made that the page does not conform, but could conform if certain parts were removed. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.0 at level X if the following parts from uncontrolled sources were removed." In addition, the following would also be true of uncontrolled content that is described in the statement of partial conformance:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>It is not content that is under the author's control.</li>
							<li>It is described in a way that users can identify (e.g., they cannot be described as "all parts that we do not control" unless they are clearly marked as such.)</li>

				<h2>Statement of Partial Conformance - Language</h2>
				<p>A "statement of partial conformance due to language" may be made when the page does not conform, but would conform if <a>accessibility support</a> existed for (all of) the language(s) used on the page. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.0 at level X if accessibility support existed for the following language(s):"</p>

					<p>To qualify as an accessibility-supported use of a Web content technology (or feature of a technology), both 1 and 2 must be satisfied for a Web content technology (or feature):</p>
					<ol>
						<li><p><strong>The way that the <a>Web content technology</a> is used must be supported by users' assistive technology (AT). </strong> This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability with users' assistive technology in the <a>human language(s)</a> of the content,</p>
							<p><strong>AND</strong></p></li>
						<li><p><strong>The Web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are available to users. </strong> This means that at least one of the following four statements is true:</p>
							<ol>
								<li><p>The technology is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents that are also accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS);</p>
									<p><strong>OR</strong></p></li>
								<li><p>The technology is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in that is also accessibility supported;</p>
									<p><strong>OR</strong></p></li>
								<li><p>The content is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate network, where the user agent required by the technology and used by the organization is also accessibility supported;</p>
									<p><strong>OR</strong></p></li>
								<li><p>The user agent(s) that support the technology are accessibility supported and are available for download or purchase in a way that:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>does not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability <strong>and</strong></li>
										<li>is as easy to find and obtain for a person with a disability as it is for a person without disabilities.</li>
									</ul></li>
							</ol></li>
					</ol>
					<p>The WCAG Working group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive technologies there must be for a particular use of a Web technology in order for it to be classified as accessibility supported. (See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"</a>.)</p>
					<p>Web technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long as they are not <a>relied upon</a> and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including <a href="#cc4"></a> and <a href="#cc5"></a>, are met.</p>
					<p>When a <a>Web Technology</a> is used in a way that is "accessibility supported," it does not imply that the entire technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to meet WCAG requirements.</p>
					<p>When citing Web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported should be specified.</p>
					<p>One way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported. (See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses</a>.) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported ways of using Web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web content technologies above.</p>

					<p>functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).</p>
					<p>Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.</p>
					<p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.</p>
					<p>Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;</li>
						<li>screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;</li>
						<li>text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;</li>
						<li>speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;</li>

								<li>the non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides a mechanism to reach the conforming version</li>
							</ol></li>
					</ol>
					<p>In this definition, "can only be reached" means that there is some mechanism, such as a conditional redirect, that prevents a user from "reaching" (loading) the non-conforming page unless the user had just come from the conforming version.</p>
					<p>The alternate version does not need to be matched page for page with the original (e.g., the conforming alternate version may consist of multiple pages).</p>
					<p>If multiple language versions are available, then conforming alternate versions are required for each language offered.</p>
					<p>Alternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments or user groups. Each version should be as conformant as possible. One version would need to be fully conformant in order to meet <a href="#cc1">conformance requirement 1</a>.</p>
					<p>The conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance, or even on the same Web site, as long as it is as freely available as the non-conforming version.</p>
					<p>Alternate versions should not be confused with <a>supplementary content</a>, which support the original page and enhance comprehension.</p>

					</ul>
					<p>Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).</p>
					<p>Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.</p>
					<p>For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no background color is specified, then white is assumed.</p>
					<p>Background color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text color is specified when a background color is specified.</p>
					<p>When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.</p>
					<p>WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except where caused by authors' code.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>there are no more than three <strong>general flashes</strong> and / or no more than three <strong>red flashes</strong> within any one-second period; or</li>
						<li>the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10 degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance</li>
					</ol>
					<p>where:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A <strong>general flash</strong> is defined as a pair of opposing changes in <a>relative luminance</a> of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance where the relative luminance of the darker image is below 0.80; and where "a pair of opposing changes" is an increase followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and</li>
						<li>A <strong>red flash</strong> is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><em>Exception:</em> Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating checkerboard pattern with "squares" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.</p>
					<p>For general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). (Higher resolutions displays showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.)</p>
					<p>A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists of two opposing transitions.</p>

					<p>A touchscreen PDA has a keyboard interface built into its operating system as well as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text applications with "keyboard emulation" functionality.</p>
					<p>Operation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface, not through its keyboard interface.</p>

				<dt><dfn>large scale (text)</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts</p>
					<p>Fonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower contrast levels.</p>
					<p>Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing that may be done by a user.</p>
					<p>The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined size and the user's display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display. The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.</p>
					<p>When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from the default sizes in a similar fashion.</p>
					<p>The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those languages and the next larger standard large print size.</p>

					<p>Almost all systems used today to view Web content assume sRGB encoding.

					<p>If dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered should be used (average R, average G, and average B).</p>
