            <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on any kind of device (including desktops, laptops, kiosks, and mobile devices). Following these guidelines will also often make web content more usable to users in general.</p>
        	<p>WCAG 2.2 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a> for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.</p>
            <p>WCAG 2.2 extends <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1</a> [[WCAG21]], which was published as a W3C Recommendation June 2018. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 also conforms to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1. The WG intends that for policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1, WCAG 2.2 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The publication of WCAG 2.2 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1. While WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 remain W3C Recommendations, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.2 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating web accessibility policies.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<section id="background-on-wcag-2">
				<h3>Background on WCAG 2</h3>
				<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.</p>
				<p>WCAG 2.2 is developed through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/">W3C process</a> in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.2 builds on WCAG 2.0 [[WCAG20]] and WCAG 2.1 [[WCAG21]], which in turn built on WCAG 1.0 [[WAI-WEBCONTENT]] and is designed to apply broadly to different web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a>.</p>
                
				<p>Significant challenges were encountered in defining additional criteria to address cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, including a short timeline for development as well as challenges in reaching consensus on testability, implementability, and international considerations of proposals. Work will carry on in this area in future versions of WCAG. We encourage authors to refer to our supplemental guidance on <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement">improving inclusion for people with disabilities, including learning and cognitive disabilities, people with low-vision, and more</a>.</p>

				<p>Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of web development and interaction work together, see:</p>

			<section id="wcag-2-layers-of-guidance">
				<h3>WCAG 2 Layers of Guidance</h3>
				<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall <em>principles</em>, general <em>guidelines</em>, testable <em>success criteria</em> and a rich collection of <em>sufficient techniques</em>, <em>advisory techniques</em>, and <em>documented common failures</em> with examples, resource links and code.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Principles</strong> - At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for web accessibility: <em>perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust</em>. See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility">Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Guidelines</strong> - Under the principles are guidelines. The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Success Criteria</strong> - For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.2 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#levels">Understanding Levels of Conformance</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Sufficient and Advisory Techniques</strong> - For each of the <em>guidelines</em> and <em>success criteria</em> in the WCAG 2.2 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of <em>techniques</em>. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are <em>sufficient</em> for meeting the success criteria and those that are <em>advisory</em>. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-techniques">Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.2</a>.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users.</p>
				<p>Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive, language, and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/">Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</a>, as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-metadata">Metadata</a> may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs. </p>

				<h3>WCAG 2.2 Supporting Documents</h3>
				<p>The WCAG 2.2 document is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical standard. Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on the WCAG 2.2 document and address other important purposes, including the ability to be updated to describe how WCAG would be applied with new technologies. Supporting documents include: </p>

        	<section id="requirements-for-wcag-2-2">
        		<h3>Requirements for WCAG 2.2</h3>
                <p>WCAG 2.2 meets a set of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/requirements/22/">requirements for WCAG 2.2</a> which, in turn, inherit requirements from previous WCAG 2 versions. Requirements structure the overall framework of guidelines and ensure backwards compatibility. The Working Group also used a less formal set of acceptance criteria for success criteria, to help ensure success criteria are similar in style and quality to those in WCAG 2.0. These requirements constrained what could be included in WCAG 2.2. This constraint was important to preserve its nature as a dot-release of WCAG 2.</p>
        	</section>
    		<section id="comparison-with-wcag-2-1">
                <h3>Comparison with WCAG 2.1</h3>
                <p>WCAG 2.2 was initiated with the goal to continue the work of WCAG 2.1: Improving accessibility guidance for three major groups: users with cognitive or learning disabilities, users with low vision, and users with disabilities on mobile devices. Many ways to meet these needs were proposed and evaluated, and a set of these were refined by the Working Group. Structural requirements inherited from WCAG 2.0, clarity and impact of proposals, and timeline led to the final set of success criteria included in this version. The Working Group considers that WCAG 2.2 incrementally advances web content accessibility guidance for all these areas, but underscores that not all user needs are met by these guidelines.</p>

				<p>WCAG 2.2 builds on and is backwards compatible with WCAG 2.1, meaning web pages that conform to WCAG 2.2 are at least as accessible as pages that conform to WCAG 2.1. Requirements have been added that build on 2.1 and 2.0. WCAG 2.2 has removed one success criterion, <a href="#parsing">4.1.1 Parsing</a>. Authors that are required by policy to conform with WCAG 2.0 or 2.1 will be able to update content to WCAG 2.2, but may need to continue to test and report 4.1.1. Authors following more than one version of the guidelines should be aware of the following additions.</p>
				<section id="new-features-in-wcag-2-2">
					<h4>New Features in WCAG 2.2</h4>
					<p>WCAG 2.2 extends WCAG 2.1 by adding new success criteria, definitions to support them, and guidelines to organize the additions. This additive approach helps to make it clear that sites which conform to WCAG 2.2 also conform to WCAG 2.1. The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group recommends that sites adopt WCAG 2.2 as their new conformance target, even if formal obligations mention previous versions, to provide improved accessibility and to anticipate future policy changes.</p>
          <p>The following success criteria are new in WCAG 2.2:</p>
                    <ul>
						<li>2.4.11 <a href="#focus-not-obscured-minimum">Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)</a> (AA)</li>
						<li>2.4.12 <a href="#focus-not-obscured-enhanced">Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</a> (AAA)</li>
                        <li>2.4.13 <a href="#focus-appearance">Focus Appearance</a> (AAA)</li>	
						<li>2.5.7 <a href="#dragging-movements">Dragging Movements</a> (AA)</li>
						<li>2.5.8 <a href="#target-size-minimum">Target Size (Minimum)</a> (AA)</li>
						<li>3.2.6 <a href="#consistent-help">Consistent Help</a> (A)</li>
						<li>3.3.7 <a href="#redundant-entry">Redundant Entry</a> (A)</li>
						<li>3.3.8 <a href="#accessible-authentication-minimum">Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</a> (AA)</li>
						<li>3.3.9 <a href="#accessible-authentication-enhanced">Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)</a> (AAA)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The new success criteria may reference new terms that have also been added to the glossary and form part of the normative requirements of the success criteria.</p>
          <p>WCAG 2.2 also introduces new sections detailing aspects of the specification which may impact <a href="#privacy-summary">privacy</a> and <a href="#security-summary">security</a>.</p>
          
				</section>
				<section id="numbering-in-wcag-2-2">
					<h4>Numbering in WCAG 2.2</h4>
					<p>In order to avoid confusion for implementers for whom backwards compatibility to WCAG 2 versions is important, new success criteria in WCAG 2.2 have been appended to the end of the set of success criteria within their guideline. This avoids the need to change the section number of success criteria from WCAG 2, which would be caused by inserting new success criteria between existing success criteria in the guideline, but it means success criteria in each guideline are no longer grouped by conformance level. The order of success criteria within each guideline does not imply information about conformance level; only the conformance level indicator (A / AA / AAA) on the success criterion itself indicates this. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/">WCAG 2.2 Quick Reference</a> will provide a way to view success criteria grouped by conformance level, along with many other filter and sort options.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="conformance-to-wcag-2-2">
					<h4>Conformance to WCAG 2.2</h4>
					<p>WCAG 2.2 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0. It is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.2 also conform to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1, while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web. </p>

        	<section id="later-versions-of-accessibility-guidelines">
        		<h3>Later Versions of Accessibility Guidelines</h3>
        		<p>In parallel with WCAG 2.2, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is developing another major version of accessibility guidelines. The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The work follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.2 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0. The Working Group might also develop additional interim versions, continuing with WCAG 2.2, on a similar short timeline to provide additional support while the major version is completed. </p>

                <h2>Statement of Partial Conformance - Third Party Content</h2>
                <p>Web pages that will later have additional content added can use a 'statement of partial conformance'. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.</p>
                <p>In these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>A determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;</p>
                        <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
