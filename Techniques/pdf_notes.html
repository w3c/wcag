<h3><a name="pdf_notes" id="pdf_notes"> </a>PDF Technology Notes</h3><div class="div3"><h3><a name="pdf_notes_intro" id="pdf_notes_intro"> </a>Introduction</h3><p>The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format for representing documents in a manner independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system used to create them, as well as of the output device on which they are to be displayed or printed. PDF files specify the appearance of pages in a document in a reliable, device-independent manner. The PDF specification was introduced by Adobe Systems in 1993 as a publicly available standard. In January 2008, PDF 1.7 became an ISO standard (ISO 32000-1). </p><p>Of note for accessibility is PDF/UA (Universal Accessibility) which became an ISO Standard in July 2012 (ISO 14289-1:2012 (See <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54564">PDF/UA (ISO 14289-1:2012)</a>.) The scope of PDF/UA is not meant to be a techniques (how-to) specification, but rather a set of guidelines for creating more accessible PDF. The specification describes the required and prohibited components and the conditions governing their inclusion in or exclusion from a PDF file in order for the file to be available to the widest possible audience, including those with disabilities. The mechanisms for including the components in the PDF stream are left to the discretion of the individual developer, PDF generator, or PDF viewing agent. PDF/UA also specifies the rules governing the behavior for a conforming reader. </p></div><div class="div3"><h3><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup"> </a>PDF Accessibility Support</h3><p>PDF includes several features in support of accessibility of documents
  				to users with disabilities. The core of this support lies in the ability
  				to determine the logical order of content in a PDF document, independently
  				of the content's appearance or layout, through logical structure and
  				Tagged PDF. Applications can extract the content of
  				a document for presentation to users with disabilities by traversing
  				the structure hierarchy and presenting the contents of each node. For
  				this reason, producers of PDF files must ensure that all information
  				in a document is reachable by means of the structure hierarchy. </p><div class="div4"><h4><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_structure" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_structure"> </a>Logical Structure</h4><p>PDF's logical structure features (introduced in PDF 1.3) provide a
  				mechanism for incorporating structural information about a document's
  				content into a PDF file. Such information might include, for example,
  				the organization of the document into chapters, headings, paragraphs
  				and sections or the identification of special elements such as figures,
  				tables, and footnotes. The logical structure features are extensible,
  				allowing applications that produce PDF files to choose what structural
  				information to include and how to represent it, while enabling PDF
  				consumers to navigate a file without knowing the producer's structural
  				conventions. </p><p>PDF logical structure shares basic features with standard document
  				markup languages such as HTML, SGML, and XML. A document's logical
  				structure is expressed as a hierarchy of structure elements, each represented
  				by a dictionary object. Like their counterparts in other markup languages,
  				PDF structure elements can have content and attributes. In PDF, rendered
  				document content takes over the role occupied by text in HTML, SGML,
  				and XML. </p><p>A PDF document's logical structure is stored separately from its visible
  				content, with pointers from each to the other. This separation allows
  				the ordering and nesting of logical elements to be entirely independent
  				of the order and location of graphics objects on the document's pages. </p><p>The logical structure of a document is described by a hierarchy of
  				objects called the structure hierarchy or structure tree. At the root
  				of the hierarchy is a dictionary object called the structure tree root,
  				located by means of the StructTreeRoot entry in the document catalog.
    					See Section 14.7.2, ("Structure Hierarchy") in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
  					1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</a>: Table 322 shows the entries in the structure
  				tree root dictionary. The K entry specifies the immediate children
  				of the structure tree root, which are structure elements. </p></div><div class="div4"><h4><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_tagged" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_tagged"> </a>Tagged PDF</h4><p>Tagged PDF (PDF 1.4) is a stylized use of PDF that builds on PDF's
  			logical structure framework. It defines a set of standard structure
  			types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images)
  			to be extracted and reused for other purposes. It is intended for use
  			by tools that perform the following types of operations: </p><ul><li><p>Simple extraction of text and graphics for pasting into other applications. </p></li><li><p>Automatic reflow of text and associated graphics to fit a page
  			of a different size than was assumed for the original layout. </p></li><li><p>Processing text for such purposes as searching, indexing, and spell-checking. </p></li><li><p>Conversion to other common file formats (such as HTML, XML, and
  			RTF) with document structure and basic styling information preserved. </p></li><li><p>Making content accessible to people who rely on assistive technology. </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="div3"><h3><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files"> </a>PDF File Production and Accessibility</h3><p>PDF files may be produced either directly by application programs or indirectly by conversion from other file formats or imaging models. In addition, tools exist for inspecting, checking, and repairing PDF files for accessibility. The following sections provide representative lists of applications and tools typically used for these functions. </p><p>These notes do not, and cannot, provide an exhaustive list, nor do they endorse particular applications and tools. Rather they provide a snapshot of tools in fairly wide use at the time the WCAG Working Group undertook to review and publish techniques for producing PDF documents. As with any software, application support for PDF accessibility will vary with different versions, with the formatting requirements of specific PDF documents, and with actual usage of the application. That is, the tools can be used properly to produce appropriate tags, etc.. </p><p>In general, newer tools will provide greater support than earlier ones. The tools' vendors are the source of authoritative information about their support for PDF accessibility. </p><div class="div4"><h4><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_generating" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_generating"> </a>Generating PDF Files</h4><p>Many applications can generate PDF files directly, and some can import
  			them as well. This direct approach is preferable, since it gives the
  			application access to the full capabilities of PDF, including the imaging
  			model and the interactive and document interchange features. Alternatively,
  			applications that do not generate PDF directly can produce PDF output
  			indirectly. There are two principal indirect methods: </p><ul><li><p>The application describes its printable output by making calls
  			to an application programming interface (API) such as GDI in Microsoft®
  			Windows® or QuickDraw in the Apple Mac OS. A software component called
  			a printer driver intercepts these calls and interprets them to generate
  			output in PDF form. </p></li><li><p>The application produces printable output directly in some other
  				file format, such as PostScript, PCL, HPGL, or DVI, which is converted
  				to PDF by a separate translation program. </p></li></ul><p>Although these indirect strategies are often the easiest way to obtain
  			PDF output from an existing application, the resulting PDF files may
  			not make the best use of the high-level PDF imaging model relied upon to expose the semantics of the document. This is
  			because the information embodied in the application's API calls or
  			in the intermediate output file often describes the desired results
  			at too low a level. Any higher-level information maintained by the
  			original application has been lost and is not available to the printer
  			driver or translator. </p><p>For example, since the printer driver or translator targets correct visual output, information about the semantics of the document may not be sent at all or may be ignored when creating the PDF output. As a result, headings may not be tagged as such, or link text may not be associated with its link object. Check with the vendor of any PDF authoring tool in order to understand how to use the tool in a way that produces the best tagged output.</p></div><div class="div4"><h4><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_applications" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_applications"> </a>PDF Authoring Tools that Provide Accessibility Support</h4><ul><li><p>Adobe Acrobat's PDFMaker - PDFMaker is part of Adobe Acrobat

    					to assistive technology such as screen readers: </p><ul><li><p>On the Microsoft® Windows® operating system, Acrobat and Adobe
    					Reader export PDF content as Component Object Model (COM) objects. Accessibility applications
    					such as screen readers can interface with Acrobat or Adobe Reader
    					in two ways:</p><ul><li><p>Through the Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) interface,
    						using MSAA objects that Acrobat or Adobe Reader exports </p></li><li><p>Directly through exported COM objects that allow access to
    							the PDF document's internal structure, called the Document Object
    							Model (DOM). </p></li></ul></li><li><p>On UNIX® platforms, Adobe Reader supports the Gnome accessibility
    					architecture. C-based Accessibility Toolkit (ATK) interfaces are
    					available. </p></li></ul><p>The DOM and MSAA models are related, and developers can use either
    					or both. Acrobat issues notifications to accessibility clients about
    					interesting events occurring in the PDF file window and responds to
    					requests from such clients. Recent versions of Acrobat and Reader have
    					enhanced the support for accessibility interfaces: </p><ul><li><p>MSAA interfaces are supported in Acrobat/Reader 5.0 and later. </p></li><li><p>In Acrobat/Reader 6.0 and later, information about the underlying
    					PDF structure is made available through direct COM objects that represent
    					the PDF DOM. The DOM accessibility interfaces provide somewhat more
    					extensive access. </p></li><li><p>In Acrobat/Reader 7.0 and later, ATK and expanded DOM support is
    						available. </p></li><li><p>The Linux®, Solaris™, AIX®, and HP-UX versions of Adobe Reader
    							implement C-based ATK interfaces, allowing screen readers, screen
    							magnifiers, and on-screen keyboards to query an Accessibility Technology
    							- Service Providers Interface (AT-SPI) registry for applications
    							that are accessible. </p></li><li><p>The DOM has been expanded to provide enhanced caret, selection,
