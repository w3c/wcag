		<div class="div2"> <h3><a name="pdf_notes" id="pdf_notes"> </a>PDF Technology Notes</h3><div class="div3"><h3><a name="pdf_notes_intro" id="pdf_notes_intro"> </a>Introduction</h3><p>The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format for representing documents in a manner independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system used to create them, as well as of the output device on which they are to be displayed or printed. PDF files specify the appearance of pages in a document in a reliable, device-independent manner. The PDF specification was introduced by Adobe Systems in 1993 as a publicly available standard. In July 2008, PDF 1.7 became an ISO standard (ISO 32000-1) <a href="#ISO32000">[ISO32000]</a>.</p><p>Of note for accessibility is PDF/UA (Universal Accessibility) which became an ISO Standard in July 2012, and was updated in 2014 (ISO 14289-1:2014 (See <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=64599">PDF/UA (ISO 14289-1:2014)</a>.) The scope of PDF/UA is not meant to be a techniques (how-to) specification, but rather a set of guidelines for creating more accessible PDF. The specification describes the required and prohibited components and the conditions governing their inclusion in or exclusion from a PDF file in order for the file to be available to the widest possible audience, including those with disabilities. The mechanisms for including the components in the PDF stream are left to the discretion of the individual developer, PDF generator, or PDF viewing agent. PDF/UA also specifies the rules governing the behavior for a conforming reader. </p></div><div class="div3"><h3><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup"> </a>PDF Accessibility Support</h3><p>PDF includes several features in support of accessibility of documents
  				to users with disabilities. The core of this support lies in the ability
  				to determine the logical order of content in a PDF document, independently
  				of the content's appearance or layout, through logical structure and
  				Tagged PDF. Applications can extract the content of
  				a document for presentation to users with disabilities by traversing
  				the structure hierarchy and presenting the contents of each node. For
  				this reason, producers of PDF files must ensure that all information
  				in a document is reachable by means of the structure hierarchy. </p><div class="div4"><h4><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_structure" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_structure"> </a>Logical Structure</h4><p>PDF's logical structure features (introduced in PDF 1.3) provide a
  				mechanism for incorporating structural information about a document's
  				content into a PDF file. Such information might include, for example,
  				the organization of the document into chapters, headings, paragraphs
  				and sections or the identification of special elements such as figures,
  				tables, and footnotes. The logical structure features are extensible,
  				allowing applications that produce PDF files to choose what structural
  				information to include and how to represent it, while enabling PDF
  				consumers to navigate a file without knowing the producer's structural
  				conventions. </p><p>PDF logical structure shares basic features with standard document
  				markup languages such as HTML, SGML, and XML. A document's logical
  				structure is expressed as a hierarchy of structure elements, each represented
  				by a dictionary object. Like their counterparts in other markup languages,
  				PDF structure elements can have content and attributes. In PDF, rendered
  				document content takes over the role occupied by text in HTML, SGML,
  				and XML. </p><p>A PDF document's logical structure is stored separately from its visible
  				content, with pointers from each to the other. This separation allows
  				the ordering and nesting of logical elements to be entirely independent
  				of the order and location of graphics objects on the document's pages. </p><p>The logical structure of a document is described by a hierarchy of
  				objects called the structure hierarchy or structure tree. At the root
  				of the hierarchy is a dictionary object called the structure tree root,
  				located by means of the StructTreeRoot entry in the document catalog.
    					See Section 14.7.2, ("Structure Hierarchy") in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
  					1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</a>: Table 322 shows the entries in the structure
  				tree root dictionary. The K entry specifies the immediate children
  				of the structure tree root, which are structure elements. </p></div><div class="div4"><h4><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_tagged" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_tagged"> </a>Tagged PDF</h4><p>Tagged PDF (PDF 1.4) is a stylized use of PDF that builds on PDF's
  			logical structure framework. It defines a set of standard structure
  			types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images)
  			to be extracted and reused for other purposes. It is intended for use
  			by tools that perform the following types of operations: </p><ul><li><p>Simple extraction of text and graphics for pasting into other applications. </p></li><li><p>Automatic reflow of text and associated graphics to fit a page
  			of a different size than was assumed for the original layout. </p></li><li><p>Processing text for such purposes as searching, indexing, and spell-checking. </p></li><li><p>Conversion to other common file formats (such as HTML, XML, and
  			RTF) with document structure and basic styling information preserved. </p></li><li><p>Making content accessible to people who rely on assistive technology. </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="div3"><h3><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files"> </a>PDF File Production and Accessibility</h3><p>PDF files may be produced either directly by application programs or indirectly by conversion from other file formats or imaging models. In addition, tools exist for inspecting, checking, and repairing PDF files for accessibility. The following sections provide representative lists of applications and tools typically used for these functions. </p><p>These notes do not, and cannot, provide an exhaustive list, nor do they endorse particular applications and tools. Rather they provide a snapshot of tools in fairly wide use at the time the WCAG Working Group undertook to review and publish techniques for producing PDF documents. As with any software, application support for PDF accessibility will vary with different versions, with the formatting requirements of specific PDF documents, and with actual usage of the application. That is, the tools can be used properly to produce appropriate tags, etc.. </p><p>In general, newer tools will provide greater support than earlier ones. The tools' vendors are the source of authoritative information about their support for PDF accessibility. </p><div class="div4"><h4><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_generating" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_generating"> </a>Generating PDF Files</h4><p>Many applications can generate PDF files directly, and some can import
  			them as well. This direct approach is preferable, since it gives the
  			application access to the full capabilities of PDF, including the imaging
  			model and the interactive and document interchange features. Alternatively,
  			applications that do not generate PDF directly can produce PDF output
  			indirectly. There are two principal indirect methods: </p><ul><li><p>The application describes its printable output by making calls
  			to an application programming interface (API) such as GDI in Microsoft®
  			Windows® or QuickDraw in the Apple Mac OS. A software component called
  			a printer driver intercepts these calls and interprets them to generate
  			output in PDF form. </p></li><li><p>The application produces printable output directly in some other
  				file format, such as PostScript, PCL, HPGL, or DVI, which is converted
  				to PDF by a separate translation program. </p></li></ul><p>Although these indirect strategies are often the easiest way to obtain
  			PDF output from an existing application, the resulting PDF files may
  			not make the best use of the high-level PDF imaging model relied upon to expose the semantics of the document. This is
  			because the information embodied in the application's API calls or
  			in the intermediate output file often describes the desired results
  			at too low a level. Any higher-level information maintained by the
  			original application has been lost and is not available to the printer
  			driver or translator. </p><p>For example, since the printer driver or translator targets correct visual output, information about the semantics of the document may not be sent at all or may be ignored when creating the PDF output. As a result, headings may not be tagged as such, or link text may not be associated with its link object. Check with the vendor of any PDF authoring tool in order to understand how to use the tool in a way that produces the best tagged output.</p></div><div class="div4"><h4><a name="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_applications" id="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_applications"> </a>PDF Authoring Tools that Provide Accessibility Support</h4><ul><li><p>Adobe Acrobat's PDFMaker - PDFMaker is part of Adobe Acrobat

    					to assistive technology such as screen readers: </p><ul><li><p>On the Microsoft® Windows® operating system, Acrobat and Adobe
    					Reader export PDF content as Component Object Model (COM) objects. Accessibility applications
    					such as screen readers can interface with Acrobat or Adobe Reader
    					in two ways:</p><ul><li><p>Through the Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) interface,
    						using MSAA objects that Acrobat or Adobe Reader exports </p></li><li><p>Directly through exported COM objects that allow access to
    							the PDF document's internal structure, called the Document Object
    							Model (DOM). </p></li></ul></li><li><p>On UNIX® platforms, Adobe Reader supports the Gnome accessibility
    					architecture. C-based Accessibility Toolkit (ATK) interfaces are
    					available. </p></li></ul><p>The DOM and MSAA models are related, and developers can use either
    					or both. Acrobat issues notifications to accessibility clients about
    					interesting events occurring in the PDF file window and responds to
    					requests from such clients. Recent versions of Acrobat and Reader have
    					enhanced the support for accessibility interfaces: </p><ul><li><p>MSAA interfaces are supported in Acrobat/Reader 5.0 and later. </p></li><li><p>In Acrobat/Reader 6.0 and later, information about the underlying
    					PDF structure is made available through direct COM objects that represent
    					the PDF DOM. The DOM accessibility interfaces provide somewhat more
    					extensive access. </p></li><li><p>In Acrobat/Reader 7.0 and later, ATK and expanded DOM support is
    						available. </p></li><li><p>The Linux®, Solaris™, AIX®, and HP-UX versions of Adobe Reader
    							implement C-based ATK interfaces, allowing screen readers, screen
    							magnifiers, and on-screen keyboards to query an Accessibility Technology
    							- Service Providers Interface (AT-SPI) registry for applications
    							that are accessible. </p></li><li><p>The DOM has been expanded to provide enhanced caret, selection,

    				images via an /Alt entry in the property list for a Tag. This is normally
    				accomplished using a tool for authoring PDF. </p><p>PDF documents may be enhanced by providing alternative descriptions
    				for images, formulas, and other items that do not translate naturally
    				into text. In fact, such text alternatives are required for accessibility:
    				alternate descriptions are human-readable text that can be vocalized
    				by text-to-speech technology for the benefit of users with vision disabilities. </p><p>When an image contains words that are important to understanding the
    				content, the text alternative should include those words. This will
    				allow the alternative to accurately represent the image. Note that
    				it does not necessarily describe the visual characteristics of the
    				image itself but must convey the same meaning as the image. </p></div><h3 class="small-head" id="PDF1-examples">Examples</h3><h4 class="small-head" id="PDF1-ex1">Example 1: Adding an /Alt entry to an image using Adobe Acrobat

    				The reading order of a PDF document is determined primarily by the tag order of document elements, including interactive elements, but the order of content within individual tags is determined by the PDF document’s content tree structure.</p><p>If the reading order is not correct, keyboard and assistive technology
    				users may not be able to understand the content. For example, some
    				documents use multiple columns, and the reading order is clear visually
    				to sighted users as flowing from the top to the bottom of the first
    				column, then to the top of the next column. But if the document is
    				not properly tagged, a screen reader may read the document from top
    				to bottom, across both columns, interpreting them as one column. </p><p>The simplest way to ensure correct reading order is to structure the
    				document correctly in the authoring tool used to create the document,
    				before conversion to tagged PDF. Note, however, that pages with complex
    				layouts with graphics, tables, footnotes, side-bars, form fields, and
    				other elements may not convert to tagged PDF in the correct reading
    				order. These inconsistencies must then be corrected with repair tools
    				such as Acrobat Pro. </p><p>When a PDF document containing form fields has a correct reading order,
    				all form fields are contained in the tab order in the appropriate order,
    				and in the correct order relative to other content in the PDF. Common
    				tab-order errors include: </p><ul><li><p> Form fields missing from the tagged content. </p></li><li><p> Form fields in the wrong location in the PDF content; e.g., at
    				the end of non-interactive content. </p></li></ul></div><h3 class="small-head" id="PDF3-examples">Examples</h3><h4 class="small-head" id="PDF3-ex1">Example 1: Creating a 2-column document using Microsoft Word 2007</h4><div class="example"><div class="textbody"><p>This example is shown with Microsoft Word.

Also see <a href="#pdf_notes">PDF Technology Notes</a>.</p></div><h3 id="PDF5-description">Description</h3><div class="textbody"><p>The objective of this technique is to notify the user when a field
    				that must be completed has not been completed in a PDF form. Required
    				fields are implemented using the /Ff entry in the form field's dictionary
    				(see Table 220 in Section 12.7 (Interactive Forms) of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
    					1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</a>. This is normally accomplished using a tool for
    				authoring PDF. </p><p>If errors are found, an alert dialog describes the nature of the error
    				in text. This may be accomplished through scripting created by the
    				author (see, for example, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20160913/SCR18.html" class="tech-ref">SCR18:
    					Providing client-side validation and alert</a>). User agents, such
    				as Adobe Acrobat Pro and LiveCycle, can provide automatic alerts (as
    				described in the examples below). </p><p>
         <em>Note</em>: once the user dismisses the alert dialog, it
    				may be helpful if the script positions the keyboard focus on the field
    				where the error occurred, although some users may expect the focus
    				to remain on the last control focused prior to the alert appearing.
    				Authors should exercise care to ensure that any movement of the focus
    				will be expected. For example, if the alert announces a missing required
    				phone number, positioning the focus on the phone number field when
    				the alert is dismissed can be regarded as helpful and expected. In
    				some cases, however, this may not be possible. If multiple input errors
    				occur on the page, another approach must be taken to error reporting. 
(See, for example, the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript.html">Adobe scripting resources.</a>) </p><p>Ensuring that users are aware an error has occurred, can determine
    				what is wrong, and can correct it are keys to software usability and
    				accessibility. Meeting this objective helps ensure that all users can
    				complete transactions with ease and confidence. </p><div id="PDF5_labels"><h5> Labels for required form controls </h5><p>It is also important that users are aware that an error <em>may</em> occur.
    				You can incorporate this information in labels; for example,   "Date
    				(required)" or the use of a red asterisk to indicate required
    				fields. (Make sure that a legend appears on each form with required
    				fields, e.g., "* = required field".)

    				can be marked up so that they are recognized by assistive technology.
    				This is typically accomplished by using a tool for authoring PDF. </p><p>Tabular information must be presented in a way that preserves relationships
    				within the information even when users cannot see the table or the
    				presentation format is changed. Information is considered tabular when
    				logical relationships among text, numbers, images, or other data exist
    				in two dimensions (vertical and horizontal). These relationships are
    				represented in columns and rows, and the columns and rows must be recognizable
    				in order for the logical relationships to be perceived. </p><p>Tagged tables can be created using the Add Tags to Document feature
    				in Adobe Acrobat, using the Object Library in Adobe LiveCycle, or converting
    				tables to PDF from a third-party application, such as Microsoft Word.
    				However, the resulting tables may not be tagged correctly and you should
    				ensure that table tagging issues are resolved. </p><p>Within PDF documents, a table uses the following structure types for
    				table elements: </p><ul><li><p> A table element (<em>Table</em>). </p></li><li><p> One or more table row elements(<em>TR</em>) which define each
    				row of table cells as immediate children of the <em>Table</em> element. </p></li><li><p> One or more table header elements (<em>TH</em>) or table data
    					elements (<em>TD</em>) as the immediate children of each table row
    					element. </p></li><li><p> Cells that span two or more rows or columns should use the <em>RowSpan</em> or <em>ColSpan</em> attribute. </p></li><li><p> For tables that contain blank cells, you may need to add empty <em>TD</em> cells
    						so that each row or column has the same number of cells. </p></li></ul></div><h3 class="small-head" id="PDF6-examples">Examples</h3><h4 class="small-head" id="PDF6-ex1">Example 1: Creating tables in Microsoft Word 2007 that have correctly

    				be available as   "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)" on
    				its first occurrence in a document. </p><p>This is done by setting expansion text using an /E entry for a structure
    				element, and is normally accomplished using a tool for authoring PDF.
    				A Span structure element is typically used to tag the abbreviation,
    				but the /E entry is valid with any structure element. </p><p>This technique is applicable for any abbreviation, including acronyms
    				and initialisms. Note that on the first occurrence of the abbreviation,
    				both the abbreviation and the expansion text must be provided. This
    				will aid recognition of later use of the abbreviation. </p><p>PDF documents may be enhanced by providing expansions for abbreviations.
    				In fact, such expansions are required for accessibility to ensure understanding
    				by people who have difficulty decoding words; rely on screen magnification
    				(which may obscure context); have limited memory; or who have difficulty

Also see <a href="#pdf_notes">PDF Technology Notes</a>.</p></div><h3 id="PDF10-description">Description</h3><div class="textbody"><p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users of assistive
    				technology are able to perceive form control labels and understand
    				how form controls are used. </p><p>Form controls allow users to interact with a PDF document by filling
    				in information or indicating choices which can then be submitted for
    				processing. Assistive technology users must be able to recognize and
    				understand the form fields, make selections, and provide input to complete
    				the forms, and submit the form, just as sighted users can. Understandable
    				labels that convey the purpose of each form control are essential to
    				form accessibility. </p><p>Form inputs generally have labels and instructions to help users understand
    				what information is required and how to fill in the form. Unless these
    				labels are programmatically associated with the relevant fields, assistive
    				technology might not be able to associate them correctly, and thus
    				users might not understand how to complete the form. </p><p>Using Adobe Acrobat Pro with documents with interactive forms, you
    				can make sure that the forms are accessible and usable by making sure
    				that programmatically associated labels that convey the purpose of
    				the fields are provided. </p><p>The heuristics used by assistive technology will sometimes use the
    				text label if a programmatically associated label cannot be found.
    				The TU entry (which is the tooltip) of the
    				field dictionary is the programmatically
    				associated label (see Example
    				3 below and Table 220 in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
    				1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</a>). Therefore, add a tooltip to each field to provide
    				a label that assistive technology can interpret.</p><div id="PDF10_placement-rules"><h5>Placement rules</h5><p>The table below lists the placement rules governing where Adobe LiveCycle
    					positions labels by default. Note that these rules assume left-to-right
    					text directionality. If your form requires different positioning (e.g.,
    					to accommodate PDF documents in languages that use right-to-left text
    					directionality), see <em>Repositioning form labels</em> in Example
    					2 below. In general, authors should review label positioning to make
    					sure it meets the requirements of their particular form. </p><a name="PDF10_placement-rules_table" id="PDF10_placement-rules_table"> </a><table border="1" cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr valign="top"><th> Control Type </th><th> LiveCycle Placement Rules </th></tr><tr valign="top"><td>

See the list of other software tools in <a href="#pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_applications">PDF Authoring Tools that Provide Accessibility Support</a>.</p><p>LiveCycle Designer provides several options for associating descriptive
    					text and labels with form elements. </p><p>For sighted or low-vision users, it is important to properly position
    						the label adjacent to the control. For screen reader users, you should
    						also ensure that the label is programmatically associated with the

Text is announced in the order shown in the list: custom text, tool tip, caption, and name." height="574" width="284"/> 
               </p><p>The label that a screen reader uses does not necessarily have to be
    							the same as the visual caption. In some cases, you may want to provide
    							more information about a form element's purpose. </p><p>To specify what text should be announced by the screen reader for
    							a particular object, you can use the Accessibility Palette's Screen
    							Reader Precedence drop down list. Text is announced in the order shown
    							in the list: custom text, tool tip, caption, and name. </p><p>Depending on the complexity and difficulty of your form, you must
    							decide which option best suits the requirements for your form. </p><p>By default, a screen reader searches for an object's text in order
    							shown in the image. Once descriptive text has been found for a control,
    							the search stops. </p><p>The image below shows an example of a text field with a visual caption
    							that might be unclear for screen reader users. One of the fields has
    							a caption of "Date" but screen reader users may want to know
    							the preferred date format (shown as screen text). So this text is provided
    							in the tooltip. Because a tooltip has a higher precedence than the
    							visual caption, the screen reader uses the tooltip. </p><p>

               </p></div><div><h5>Labeling radio buttons</h5><p>When a screen reader user tabs into a radio button, the screen reader
    							needs to announce two items: </p><ul><li><p> A general description of the purpose of the <em>group</em> of
    							buttons </p></li><li><p> A meaningful description for the purpose of <em>each</em> radio
    								button </p></li></ul><p>To make radio buttons accessible: </p><ol class="enumar"><li><p> In the Hierarchy palette, select the radio button group. </p></li><li><p> Select the Accessibility palette and in the Custom Screen Reader
    							Text box, type the speak text for the group. For example, type   "Select
    							a method of payment." </p></li><li><p> In the Hierarchy palette, select the first radio button in the
    								group. </p></li><li><p> In the Object palette, select the Field tab. In the Item area,
    									select the item and type a meaningful value for the selected radio
    									button. For example, type "Cash." </p></li><li><p> Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each radio button in the group. </p></li></ol><p>
                  <img class="eximg" src="/WAI/WCAG20/Techniques/working-examples/PDF10/radiobuttongroup.jpg" alt="Image of Custom Screen Reader Text for radio buttons in LiveCycle Designer." height="237" width="526"/> 
               </p></div><div><h5>Repositioning form labels</h5><p>The placement of a caption, or label, is important because users expect
    							them to be found at a particular location adjacent to the control.
    							For screen magnification users this is even more important, as they
    							might not be able to view both the control and the label at the same
    							time. </p><p>When you create an object, Adobe LiveCycle Designer automatically
    							positions the label as specified by the control type (see the table
    							in the Description above). For example, for a text field, the label
    							is positioned to the left of the control. </p><p>If you need to change the position of the label text (for example,
    							to accommodate right-to-left text directionality): </p><ol class="enumar"><li><p> Select the object by moving the focus to it. </p></li><li><p> In the Layout palette, under Caption at the bottom of the palette,
    							select the position of your object from the Position drop-down list. </p></li></ol><p>

               </p><p>The resulting repositioned label is shown below. The label for the
    							Date text field has been moved from the left of the field to the line
    							above the field. </p><p>

    				can be marked up to be recognizable by keyboard and assistive technology
    				users. That is, the link information is programmatically available
    				to user agents so that links are recognizable when presented in a different
    				format. This is typically accomplished by using a tool for authoring
    				PDF. </p><p>Links in PDF documents are represented by a Link tag and objects in
    				its sub-tree, consisting of a link object reference (or Link annotation)
    				and one or more text objects. The text object or objects inside the
    				Link tag are used by assistive technologies to provide a name for the
    				link. </p><p>The simplest way to provide links that comply with the WCAG success
    				criteria is to create them when authoring the document, before conversion
    				to PDF. </p><p>However, in some cases, it may not be possible to create the links
    				using the original authoring tool. In these cases, Adobe Acrobat Pro
    				can be used to create the link. But, because the tooltip created using
    				the Link dialog in Adobe Acrobat Pro is not accessible to screen readers,
    				be sure that the link text or the link context makes the purpose clear. </p><p>In all cases, link purpose should be made clear as described in the
    				general techniques: </p><ul><li><p>

    						region of a page rather than a particular object in a content stream.
    						For this reason, link annotations alone are not useful for users with
    						visual impairments, or to applications that must determine which content
    						can be activated to invoke a hypertext link. </p><p>Tagged PDF /Link elements use PDF's logical structure to establish
    						the association between content items and link annotations, providing
    						functionality comparable to HTML hypertext links. </p><p>In HTML, the following example produces text containing a hypertext
    						link: </p><div class="code"><pre><code>Here is some text &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/"&gt; with a link &lt;/a&gt; inside.
</code></pre></div><p>In PDF the page must be painted first and then a link annotation
    						placed over the area where the object action will occur. </p><p>The following code fragment shows PDF equivalent to the HTML above;
    						it uses link text displayed in blue and underlined. A second code fragment
    						follows, indicating the associated logical structure hierarchy. This
    						is typically accomplished by an authoring tool. </p><div class="code"><pre><code> /P &lt;&lt;/MCID 0&gt;&gt;                                                %Marked Content Sequence 0 (paragraph)

    				via the /Alt entry in the property list for a tag. This is usually

    				the visible link text is needed, particularly for screen reader users.
    				Screen readers can read visible link text, but replacing the screen
    				text with meaningful alternate text for links in a PDF document can
    				make links more accessible. </p><p>Links in PDF documents are represented by a Link tag and objects in
    				its sub-tree, consisting of a link object reference (or Link annotation)
    				and one or more text objects. The text object or objects inside the
    				Link tag are used by assistive technologies to provide a name for the
    				link. </p><p>Authors can replace the default link text by providing an /Alt entry
    				for the Link tag. When the Link tag has an /Alt entry, screen readers

    				in a document by providing running headers and footers via pagination
    				artifacts. This is normally accomplished using a tool for authoring
    				PDF. </p><p>Running headers and footers help make content easier to use and understandable
    				by providing repeated information in a consistent and predictable way.
    				The content of headers and footers will vary widely depending on the
    				document scope and content, the audience, and design decisions. Some
    				examples of location information that may be used in headers and footers
    				are listed below. Whether the information appears in a header or a
    				footer is often a design decision; page numbers often appear in footers
    				but they may alternatively appear in headers. </p><ul><li><p> Document title </p></li><li><p> Current chapter and/or section in the document</p></li><li><p> Page numbers with location information such as, "Page 3-4" or "Page
    				9 of 15." </p></li><li><p> Author and/or date information. </p></li></ul><p>Consistency helps users with cognitive limitations, screen-reader
    				users and low-vision magnifier users, and users with intellectual disabilities
    				understand content more readily. </p><p>The easiest way to provide page headers and footers is in the authoring
    				tool for the document. Authoring tools typically provide features for
    				creating header and footer text and information (such as page numbers).
    				However, if after converting your document to PDF, you need to add
    				or modify page headers and footers, authoring or repair tools like Adobe Acrobat Pro's Header &amp; Footer
    				tools can be used. In all cases, the tools generate page headers and
    				footers in consistent and predictable layout, format, and text. </p></div><h3 class="small-head" id="PDF14-examples">Examples</h3><h4 class="small-head" id="PDF14-ex1">Example 1: Adding running headers and footers using Microsoft Word

For example, Adobe Acrobat Pro and Reader display page numbers in the Page Navigation toolbar. The page number format is specified by the /PageLabels entry in the Document Catalog.</p><p>Many documents use specific page number formats within a document. Commonly, front matter is numbered with lowercase Roman numerals. The main content, starting on the page numbered 1, may actually be the fifth or sixth page in the document. Similarly, appendices may begin with page number 1 plus a prefix of the appendix letter (e.g., "A-1").</p><p>Authors should make sure that the page numbering of their converted documents is reflected in any page number displays in their user agent. Consistency in presenting the document's page numbers will help make navigating the document more predictable and understandable.</p><p>As an example, if /PageLabels has not been provided to describe the page number formatting, the page numbering scheme will not be reflected in the Page Navigation toolbar in Adobe Acrobat Pro or Reader. This toolbar displays the page number in a text box, which users can change to move to another page. In addition, users can select the arrows to move one page up or down in the document. The toolbar also displays the relative page number location. In the image below, the default display indicates the user is on page 1 of 4 pages.</p><p>

      </p><p>A more direct way of going to a page is to use the shortcut for the View &gt; Page Navigation &gt; Page menu item.

    				list elements appropriate for their purposes. PDF files containing
    				lists are normally created or repaired using a tool for authoring PDF. </p><p>When markup is used that visually formats items as a list but does
    				not indicate the list relationship, users may have difficulty navigating
    				the information. An example of such visual formatting is simply using
    				line-breaks to separate list items. </p><p>Some assistive technologies allow users to navigate from list to list
    				or item to item. If the lists are not correctly formatted with list
    				tags, these users will have difficulty understanding the list content. </p><p>The easiest way to create lists in PDF content is to format them properly
    				using list markup in the authoring tool, for example, Microsoft Word
    				or OpenOffice.org Writer. However, if you do not have access to the
    				source file and authoring tool, you can use Acrobat Pro's TouchUp Reading
    				Order tool and the Tags panel. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
    				specification</a> defines list structure in section 14.8.4.3.3 (List
    				Elements). The structure types for lists in PDF documents are: </p><ul><li><p> L - the List tag, which contains one or more LI tags. </p></li><li><p> LI - the List Item tag. List item tags can contain Lbl and LBody
    				tags. </p></li><li><p> Lbl - the list item label. Contains distinguishing information
    					such as a item number or bullet character. </p></li><li><p> LBody - the list item body. Contains list item content, or in
    						the case of a nested list, it may contain additional List tag trees. </p></li></ul></div><h3 class="small-head" id="PDF21-examples">Examples</h3><h4 class="small-head" id="PDF21-ex1">Example 1: Adding lists to Microsoft Word 2007 documents</h4><div class="example"><div class="textbody"><p>This example is shown with Microsoft Word.

    				input to a field that requires a specific, required format (e.g.,
    				date fields) is not submitted in that format. </p><p>If the required format is not used, an alert dialog describes the
    				nature of the error in text. This may be accomplished through scripting
    				created by the author (see, for example, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/SCR18">SCR18:
    					Providing client-side validation and alert</a>). User agents, such
    				as Adobe LiveCycle can provide automatic alerts (as described in
    				the examples below). </p><div class="note"><p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>Once the user dismisses the alert dialog,
    				it may be helpful if the script positions the keyboard focus on
    				the field where the error occurred, although some users may expect
    				the focus to remain on the last control focused prior to the alert
    				appearing. Authors should exercise care to ensure that any movement
    				of the focus will be expected. For example, if the alert announces
    				an error in a phone number format, positioning the focus on the
    				phone number field when the alert is dismissed can be regarded as
    				helpful and expected. In some cases, however, this may not be possible.
    				If multiple input errors occur on the page, an alternative approach
    				to error notification should be implemented. </p></div><p>Ensuring that users are aware an error has occurred, can determine
    				what is wrong, and can correct it are key to software usability
    				and accessibility. Meeting this objective helps ensure that all
    				users can complete for-based transactions with ease and confidence. </p><div><h5>Labels for required formats in form controls</h5><p>It is also important that users are aware that an error <em>may</em> occur.
    					You can incorporate this information in labels; for example, "Date
    					(MM/DD/YYYY)."

    				controls in PDF documents allow keyboard operation. Interactive
    				PDF forms are generally created using a tool for authoring PDF.
    				Form controls are implemented in PDF documents either as described
    				in Section 12.7 (Interactive Forms) of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
    					1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</a> or as described in the <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/xml/index_arch.html">Adobe
    						XML Forms Architecture (XFA)</a>. </p><p>The types of PDF form controls are: text input field, check box,
    				radio button, combo box, list box, and button. </p><p>Form controls allow users to interact with a PDF document by filling
    				in information or indicating choices, which can then be submitted
    				for processing. Users who rely on keyboard access must be able to
    				recognize and understand the form fields, make selections, and provide
    				input to complete the forms, and submit the form, just as sighted
    				users can. </p><p>Interactive form controls can be provided for forms created by
    				converting a scanned paper form to tagged PDF or by creating a form
    				in an authoring application such as Microsoft Word or Open Office
    				and converting it to tagged PDF. </p><p>However, documents created by authoring applications that provide
    				form design features might not fully retain their fillable form
    				fields on conversion to PDF. Complex forms in particular may not
    				have properly converted form fields and labels when tagged in conversion. </p><p>Using Adobe Acrobat Pro with forms in converted documents, you
    				can ensure that form fields are keyboard accessible and usable by: </p><ul><li><p> Opening tagged PDF documents with form fields and creating
    				interactive PDF form elements with the Run Form Fields Recognition
    				tool. </p></li><li><p> Modifying fillable form fields, or adding form fields, using
    					Adobe Acrobat Pro or Adobe LiveCycle Designer. </p></li></ul><p>Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer, you can create forms from scratch. </p></div><h3 class="small-head" id="PDF23-examples">Examples</h3><h4 class="small-head" id="PDF23-ex1">Example 1: Adding interactive controls to existing forms in PDF

    						a paper form or using an authoring tool to generate tagged PDF),
    						you can use Adobe Acrobat Pro to make the form elements keyboard
    						accessible in the same page locations as the static form. </p><ol class="enumar"><li><p> Use Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Run Form Field Recognition
