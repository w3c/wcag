# JSON Serialization of WCAG 2

The script in this folder serializes WCAG 2 information into JSON format, including:

- Principles, guidelines, and success criteria
- Glossary terms
- Associations between (normative) success criteria and (informative) techniques

The following JSON files are published monthly:

- [WCAG 2.2 JSON](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/wcag.json)
- [WCAG 2.1 JSON](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/wcag.json)

For a history of structural changes to the JSON files, see the [list of merged wcag.json pull requests](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Awcag.json), and in particular the "wcag.json Changes" section in each pull request description.
